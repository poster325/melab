Recent studies have documented the increasing intensity of summer frontal rainfall over recent decades. However, the extent of ongoing climate change on the intensification of the EA frontal precipitation system remains uncertain. Using an objective method for detecting frontal systems, we found a 17 ± 3% increase in observed frontal rainfall intensity during 1958 to 2015. Climate model simulations with and without greenhouse gases suggest that anthropogenic warming plays a key role in the intensification of EA summer frontal precipitation by 5.8% from 1991 to 2015. The analysis highlights that enhanced water vapor convergence and reinforced western North Pacific subtropical High collectively increased moisture transport to the region, resulting in intensified EA frontal precipitation. The results lend support to the anthropogenic warming-induced enhancement of the EA frontal precipitation and its persistence in the future."	https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adh4195	2023-12-08	2024-01-02	"Moon, S"	"Moon, S[Moon, Suyeon]; Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Jeong, JH[Jeong, Jee-Hoon]; Yoon, JH[Yoon, Jin-Ho]; Wang, SYS[Wang, S-Y Simon]; Shiogama, H[Shiogama, Hideo]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	7	KAIST	13.6	4.598	5.00	N	Article

Here, we investigate the role of river water storage on calibration and validation of a parsimonious global hydrological model. In a multi-criteria calibration approach, the model is constrained against either GRACE TWS or TWS from which river water storage is removed. While we find that removing river water storage changes the TWS constraint regionally and globally, there are no significant implications for model calibration and the resulting simulations. However, adding modeled river water storage a-posteriori to calibrated TWS simulations improves model validation against seasonal GRACE TWS variations globally and regionally, especially in tropics and Northern low- and wetlands. While our findings justify the exclusion of explicit river routing for global model calibration, we find that the inclusion of river water storage is relevant for model evaluation."	https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/acece5	2023-10-04	2023-10-04	"Trautmann, T"	"Trautmann, T[Trautmann, Tina]; Koirala, S[Koirala, Sujan]; Guentner, A[Guentner, Andreas]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Jung, M[Jung, Martin]"	5	KAIST	2.9	0.894	3.00	N	Article

In this Review, we summarize how irrigation currently impacts key components of the Earth system. Estimates suggest that more than 3.6 million km(2) of currently irrigated land, with hot spots in the intensively cultivated US High Plains, California Central Valley, Indo-Gangetic Basin and northern China. Process-based models estimate that similar to 2,700 +/- 540 km(3) irrigation water is withdrawn globally each year, broadly consistent with country-reported values despite these estimates embedding substantial uncertainties. Expansive irrigation has modified surface energy balance and biogeochemical cycling. A shift from sensible to latent heat fluxes, and resulting land-atmosphere feedbacks, generally reduce regional growing season surface temperatures by similar to 1-3 degrees C. Irrigation can ameliorate temperature extremes in some regions, but conversely exacerbates moist heat stress. Modelled precipitation responses are more varied, with some intensive cropping regions exhibiting suppressed local precipitation but enhanced precipitation downstream owing to atmospheric circulation interactions. Additionally, irrigation could enhance cropland carbon uptake; however, it can also contribute to elevated methane fluxes in rice systems and mobilize nitrogen loading to groundwater. Cross-disciplinary, integrative research efforts can help advance understanding of these irrigation-Earth system interactions, and identify and reduce uncertainties, biases and limitations."	https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-023-00438-5	2023-07-31	2023-08-04	"McDermid, S"	"McDermid, S[McDermid, Sonali]; Nocco, M[Nocco, Mallika]; Lawston-Parker, P[Lawston-Parker, Patricia]; Keune, J[Keune, Jessica]; Pokhrel, Y[Pokhrel, Yadu]; Jain, M[Jain, Meha]; Jagermeyr, J[Jaegermeyr, Jonas]; Brocca, L[Brocca, Luca]; Massari, C[Massari, Christian]; Jones, AD[Jones, Andrew D.]; Vahmani, P[Vahmani, Pouya]; Thiery, W[Thiery, Wim]; Yao, Y[Yao, Yi]; Bell, A[Bell, Andrew]; Chen, L[Chen, Liang]; Dorigo, W[Dorigo, Wouter]; Hanasaki, N[Hanasaki, Naota]; Jasechko, S[Jasechko, Scott]; Lo, MH[Lo, Min-Hui]; Mahmood, R[Mahmood, Rezaul]; Mishra, V[Mishra, Vimal]; Mueller, ND[Mueller, Nathaniel D.]; Niyogi, D[Niyogi, Dev]; Rabin, SS[Rabin, Sam S.]; Sloat, L[Sloat, Lindsey]; Wada, Y[Wada, Yoshihide]; Zappa, L[Zappa, Luca]; Chen, F[Chen, Fei]; Cook, BI[Cook, Benjamin I.]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Lombardozzi, D[Lombardozzi, Danica]; Polcher, J[Polcher, Jan]; Ryu, D[Ryu, Dongryeol]; Santanello, J[Santanello, Joe]; Satoh, Y[Satoh, Yusuke]; Seneviratne, S[Seneviratne, Sonia]; Singh, D[Singh, Deepti]; Yokohata, T[Yokohata, Tokuta]"	38	KAIST	42.1	6.193	5.00	N	Review

Deep learning has recently shown significant potential for improving estimation accuracy. Most studies have employed a two-stage framework, which is a sequential architecture of a rain/no-rain binary classification task followed by a rain rate regression task. This study proposes a novel precipitation retrieval framework in which these two tasks are simultaneously trained using multi-task learning approach (MTL). Furthermore, a novel network architecture and loss function were designed to reap the benefits of MTL. The proposed two-task model successfully achieved a better performance than the conventional single-task model possibly due to efficient knowledge transfer between tasks. Furthermore, the product intercomparison showed that our product outperformed existing products in rain rate retrieval and also yielded better skills in the rain/no-rain retrieval task."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL102283	2023-05-12	2023-05-13	"Bannai, T"	"Bannai, T[Bannai, Takumi]; Xu, HY[Xu, Haoyang]; Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Koo, E[Koo, Eunho]; Lu, K[Lu, Keming]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	6	KAIST	5.2	1.837	5.00	N	Article

One possible explanation of these increasing extreme cold winters comes from the so-called Warm Arctic Cold Continent (WACC) pattern, reflecting the effects of the amplified Arctic warming in driving the circulation change over surrounding continents. This study analyzed reanalysis data and model experiments forced by different levels of anthropogenic forcing. It is found that WACC exists on synoptic scales in observations, model's historical and even future runs. In the future, the analysis suggests a continued presence of WACC but with a slightly weakened cold extreme due to the overall warming. Warm Arctic events under the warmer climate will be associated with not only a colder continent in East Asia but also a warmer continent, depending on the teleconnection process that is also complicated by the warmer Arctic. Such an increasingly association suggests a reduction in potential predictability of the midlatitude winter anomalies."	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-023-00345-y	2023-04-24	2023-04-24	"Hong, Y"	"Hong, Y[Hong, Yungi]; Wang, SYS[Wang, S. -Y.

Despite remarkable advances in fire modeling and weather forecasting, it remains challenging to anticipate catastrophic wildfire events and associated damage. One key missing component is a fire weather prediction system with sufficiently long lead time capable of providing useful regional details. Here, we develop a hybrid prediction model of wildfire danger called CFS with super resolution (CFS-SR) as a proof of concept to fill that void. The CFS-SR model is constructed by integrating the Climate Forecast System version 2 with a deep learning (DL) technique from Single Image Super Resolution, a method widely used in enhancing image resolution. We show that for the 2018-2019 fire season, the CFS-SR model significantly improves accuracy in forecasting fire weather at lead times of up to 7 days with an enhanced spatial resolution up to 4 km. This level of high resolution provides county-level fire weather forecast, making it more practical for allocating resources to mitigate wildfire danger. Our study demonstrates that a proper combination of ensemble climate predictions with DL techniques can boost predictability at finer spatial scales, increasing the utility of fire weather forecasts for practical applications."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS002995	2022-11-01	2023-03-14	"Son, R"	"Son, R[Son, Rackhun]; Ma, PL[Ma, Po-Lun]; Wang, HL[Wang, Hailong]; Rasch, PJ[Rasch, Philp J.]; Wang, SY[Wang, Shih-Yu (Simon)]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Jeong, JH[Jeong, Jee-Hoon]; Lim, KSS[Lim, Kyo-Sun Sunny]; Yoon, JH[Yoon, Jin-Ho]"	9	KAIST	6.8	3.605	5.00	Y	Article

They generally encompass a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic processes, as well as drivers external to the climate system, such as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and land use change. Here we present the ExtremeX multi-model intercomparison experiment, which was designed to investigate the contribution of dynamic and thermodynamic processes to recent weather and climate extremes. The numerical experiments are performed with three Earth system models: CESM, MIROC, and EC-Earth. They include control experiments with interactive atmosphere and land surface conditions, as well as experiments wherein the atmospheric circulation, soil moisture, or both are constrained using observation-based data. The temporal evolution and magnitude of temperature anomalies during heatwaves are well represented in the experiments with a constrained atmosphere. However, the magnitude of mean climatological biases in temperature and precipitation are not greatly reduced in any of the constrained experiments due to persistent or newly introduced biases. This highlights the importance of error compensations and tuning in the standard model versions. To show one possible application, ExtremeX is used to identify the main drivers of heatwaves and warm spells. The results reveal that both atmospheric circulation patterns and soil moisture conditions substantially contribute to the occurrence of these events. Soil moisture effects are particularly important in the tropics, the monsoon areas, and the Great Plains of the United States, whereas atmospheric circulation effects are major drivers in other midlatitude and high-latitude regions."	https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1167-2022	2022-09-06	2023-03-14	"Wehrli, K"	"Wehrli, K[Wehrli, Kathrin]; Luo, F[Luo, Fei]; Hauser, M[Hauser, Mathias]; Shiogama, H[Shiogama, Hideo]; Tokuda, D[Tokuda, Daisuke]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Coumou, D[Coumou, Dim]; May, W[May, Wilhelm]; Le Sager, P[Le Sager, Philippe]; Selten, F[Selten, Frank]; Martius, O[Martius, Olivia]; Vautard, R[Vautard, Robert]; Seneviratne, SI[Seneviratne, Sonia, I]"	13	KAIST	7.3	2.298	5.00	Y	Article

Recent work showed that amplified Rossby wavenumber 5 and 7 show phase-locking behavior which can trigger simultaneous warm anomalies in different breadbasket regions in the Northern Hemisphere. These types of wave patterns thus pose a potential threat to human health and ecosystems. The representation of such persistent wave events in summer and their surface anomalies in general circulation models (GCMs) has not been systematically analyzed. Here we validate the representation of wavenumbers 1-10 in three state-of-The-Art global climate models (EC-Earth, CESM, and MIROC), quantify their biases, and provide insights into the underlying physical reasons for the biases. To do so, the ExtremeX experiments output data were used, consisting of (1) historic simulations with a freely running atmosphere with prescribed ocean and experiments that additionally (2) nudge towards the observed upper-level horizontal winds, (3) prescribe soil moisture conditions, or (4) do both. The experiments are used to trace the sources of the model biases to either the large-scale atmospheric circulation or surface feedback processes. Focusing on wave 5 and wave 7, we show that while the wave's position and magnitude are generally well represented during high-Amplitude (>g 1.5 SD) episodes, the associated surface anomalies are substantially underestimated. Near-surface temperature, precipitation and mean sea level pressure are typically underestimated by a factor of 1.5 in terms of normalized standard deviations. The correlations and normalized standard deviations for surface anomalies do not improve if the soil moisture is prescribed. However, the surface biases are almost entirely removed when the upper-level atmospheric circulation is nudged. When both prescribing soil moisture and nudging the upper-level atmosphere, then the surface biases remain quite similar to the experiment with a nudged atmosphere only. We conclude that the near-surface biases in temperature and precipitation are in the first place related to biases in the upper-level circulation. Thus, relatively small biases in the models' representation of the upper-level waves can strongly affect associated temperature and precipitation anomalies. © 2022 Authors"	https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-905-2022	2022-12-23	2022-12-23	"Luo, F"	"Luo, F[Luo, Fei]; Selten, F[Selten, Frank]; Wehrli, K[Wehrli, Kathrin]; Kornhuber, K[Kornhuber, Kai]; Le, Sager P[Le Sager, Philippe]; May, W[May, Wilhelm]; Reerink, T[Reerink, Thomas]; Seneviratne, SI[Seneviratne, Sonia I.]; Shiogama, H[Shiogama, Hideo]; Tokuda, D[Tokuda, Daisuke]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Coumou, D[Coumou, Dim]"	12	KAIST		1.515		Y	Article

Specific regions pass this timing by the middle of 21st century even with stringent mitigation. Droughts that exceed the magnitudes of historical variation ranges could occur increasingly frequently under future climate conditions. However, the time of the emergence of unprecedented drought conditions under climate change has rarely been examined. Here, using multimodel hydrological simulations, we investigate the changes in the frequency of hydrological drought (defined as abnormally low river discharge) under high and low greenhouse gas concentration scenarios and existing water resource management measures and estimate the time of the first emergence of unprecedented regional drought conditions centered on the low-flow season. The times are detected for several subcontinental-scale regions, and three regions, namely, Southwestern South America, Mediterranean Europe, and Northern Africa, exhibit particularly robust results under the high-emission scenario. These three regions are expected to confront unprecedented conditions within the next 30 years with a high likelihood regardless of the emission scenarios. In addition, the results obtained herein demonstrate the benefits of the lower-emission pathway in reducing the likelihood of emergence. The Paris Agreement goals are shown to be effective in reducing the likelihood to the unlikely level in most regions. However, appropriate and prior adaptation measures are considered indispensable when facing unprecedented drought conditions. The results of this study underscore the importance of improving drought preparedness within the considered time horizons."	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30729-2	2022-07-19	2022-07-19	"Satoh, Y"	"Satoh, Y[Satoh, Yusuke]; Yoshimura, K[Yoshimura, Kei]; Pokhrel, Y[Pokhrel, Yadu]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Shiogama, H[Shiogama, Hideo]; Yokohata, T[Yokohata, Tokuta]; Hanasaki, N[Hanasaki, Naota]; Wada, Y[Wada, Yoshihide]; Burek, P[Burek, Peter]; Byers, E[Byers, Edward]; Schmied, HM[Schmied, Hannes Mueller]; Gerten, D[Gerten, Dieter]; Ostberg, S[Ostberg, Sebastian]; Gosling, SN[Gosling, Simon Newland]; Boulange, JES[Boulange, Julien Eric Stanslas]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	16	KAIST	16.6	5.116	5.00	Y	Article

Statistical fingerprint analysis shows that this observed geographical change in heavy rainfall is related to anthropogenic climate change. The impact of climate change on tropical cyclones (TCs) is of great concern in the Western North Pacific (WNP) region. Observations suggest that there have been recent changes in TC-related heavy rainfall. However, it has not yet been determined whether anthropogenic forcing has any contribution to such changes. Here, we show evidence that the human-induced warming has considerably changed the frequency of TC-induced heavy rainfall events in the WNP region. Observations since 1961 show that the occurrence of TC-induced heavy rainfall has significantly increased along coastal East Asia, while it has decreased in the southern part of WNP. On the basis of large ensemble climate simulations, we demonstrate that the observed changes cannot be explained solely by natural variability. This suggests that anthropogenic impacts have already significantly altered the TC-induced heavy rainfall pattern in the WNP region."	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01344-2	2022-05-09	2023-03-14	"Utsumi, N"	"Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	2	KAIST	30.7	6.849	5.00	Y	Article

Although many observational constraints on Delta T have been proposed, constraints on Delta P have not been well studied(2-5) and are often complicated by the large influence of aerosols on precipitation(4). Here we show that the upper bound (95th percentile) of Delta P (2051-2100 minus 1851-1900, percentage of the 1980-2014 mean) is lowered from 6.2 per cent to 5.2-5.7 per cent (minimum-maximum range of sensitivity analyses) under a medium greenhouse gas concentration scenario. Our results come from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 and phase 6 ensembles(6-8), in which Delta P for 2051-2100 is well correlated with the global mean temperature trends during recent decades after 1980 when global anthropogenic aerosol emissions were nearly constant. Delta P is also significantly correlated with the recent past trends in precipitation when we exclude the tropical land areas with few rain-gauge observations. On the basis of these significant correlations and observed trends, the variance of Delta P is reduced by 8-30 per cent. The observationally constrained ranges of Delta P should provide further reliable information for impact assessments."	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04310-8	2022-03-21	2023-09-08	"Shiogama, H"	"Shiogama, H[Shiogama, Hideo]; Watanabe, M[Watanabe, Masahiro]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Hirota, N[Hirota, Nagio]"	4	KAIST	64.8	20.957	5.00	Y	Article

Such large-scale models are essential for examining, communicating, and understanding the dynamic interactions between the Earth system above and below the land surface as well as the opportunities and limits of groundwater resources. We argue that both large-scale and regional-scale groundwater models have utility, strengths, and limitations, so continued modeling at both scales is essential and mutually beneficial. A crucial quest is how to evaluate the realism, capabilities, and performance of large-scale groundwater models given their modeling purpose of addressing large-scale science or sustainability questions as well as limitations in data availability and commensurability. Evaluation should identify if, when, or where large-scale models achieve their purpose or where opportunities for improvements exist so that such models better achieve their purpose. We suggest that reproducing the spatiotemporal details of regional-scale models and matching local data are not relevant goals. Instead, it is important to decide on reasonable model expectations regarding when a large-scale model is performing ""well enough"" in the context of its specific purpose. The decision of reasonable expectations is necessarily subjective even if the evaluation criteria are quantitative. Our objective is to provide recommendations for improving the evaluation of groundwater representation in continental- to global-scale models. We describe current modeling strategies and evaluation practices, and we subsequently discuss the value of three evaluation strategies: (1) comparing model outputs with available observations of groundwater levels or other state or flux variables (observation-based evaluation), (2) comparing several models with each other with or without reference to actual observations (model-based evaluation), and (3) comparing model behavior with expert expectations of hydrologic behaviors in particular regions or at particular times (expert-based evaluation). Based on evolving practices in model evaluation as well as innovations in observations, machine learning, and expert elicitation, we argue that combining observation-, model-, and expert-based model evaluation approaches, while accounting for commensurability issues, may significantly improve the realism of groundwater representation in large-scale models, thus advancing our ability for quantification, understanding, and prediction of crucial Earth science and sustainability problems. We encourage greater community-level communication and cooperation on this quest, including among global hydrology and land surface modelers, local to regional hydrogeologists, and hydrologists focused on model development and evaluation."	https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7545-2021	2022-01-10	2022-01-10	"Gleeson, T"	"Gleeson, T[Gleeson, Tom]; Wagener, T[Wagener, Thorsten]; Doll, P[Doell, Petra]; Zipper, SC[Zipper, Samuel C.]; West, C[West, Charles]; Wada, Y[Wada, Yoshihide]; Taylor, R[Taylor, Richard]; Scanlon, B[Scanlon, Bridget]; Rosolem, R[Rosolem, Rafael]; Rahman, S[Rahman, Shams]; Oshinlaja, N[Oshinlaja, Nurudeen]; Maxwell, R[Maxwell, Reed]; Lo, MH[Lo, Min-Hui]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Hill, M[Hill, Mary]; Hartmann, A[Hartmann, Andreas]; Fogg, G[Fogg, Graham]; Famiglietti, JS[Famiglietti, James S.]; Ducharne, A[Ducharne, Agnes]; de Graaf, I[de Graaf, Inge]; Cuthbert, M[Cuthbert, Mark]; Condon, L[Condon, Laura]; Bresciani, E[Bresciani, Etienne]; Bierkens, MFP[Bierkens, Marc F.

Here, we analyzed the impact of two urbanization factors (anthropogenic heat flux (AH) and building height (ZR)), which could affect the formation of UHIs and UCIs, on urban precipitation over the Seoul Metropolitan area. AH caused an increasing precipitation in urban and downwind areas, especially during daytime. AH directly contributed to the sensible heat flux, resulting in surface warming associated with an UHI. Surface heat was transferred within the planetary boundary layer by turbulence, which increased the low-level instability, resulting in increased precipitation. In the experiments with the ZR, both surface temperature and precipitation increased (decreased) during the nighttime (daytime). The diurnal variation of ground heat flux intensified with an increasing ZR, inducing a smaller variation of sensible heat flux for surface energy balance. Changes in the ground heat flux could also explain occurrence of UCIs in cities with high-rises. Tall buildings reduced daytime surface temperature, thereby facilitating atmospheric stabilization, and reducing precipitation. Also, the surface friction increased with a higher ZR, resulting in enhanced convergence in the western part of urban areas where dominant westerlies first met land, which was favorable for increased precipitation. In summary, a study of variations in AH and ZR demonstrated how UHIs and UCIs significantly altered precipitation, respectively. In particular, an UCI alleviated an increment in thermo-driven daytime precipitation caused by an UHI. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

This study examines the roles of ice processes in those clouds and their interactions with aerosols using a large-eddy simulation (LES) framework. Cloud mass becomes much lower in the presence of ice processes and the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) mechanism in the mixed-phase clouds compared to that in warm clouds. This is because while the WBF mechanism enhances the evaporation of droplets, the low concentration of aerosols acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) and cloud ice number concentration (CINC) prevent the efficient deposition of water vapor. Note that the INP concentration in this study is based on the observed spatiotemporal variability of aerosols. This results in the lower CINC compared to that with empirical dependence of the INP concentrations on temperature in a previous study. In the mixed-phase clouds, the increasing concentration of aerosols that act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) decreases cloud mass by increasing the evaporation of droplets through the WBF mechanism and decreasing the intensity of updrafts. In contrast to this, in the warm clouds, the absence of the WBF mechanism makes the increase in the evaporation of droplets inefficient, eventually enabling cloud mass to increase with the increasing concentration of aerosols acting as CCN. Here, the results show that when there is an increasing concentration of aerosols that act as INPs, the deposition of water vapor is more efficient than when there is the increasing concentration of aerosols acting as CCN, which in turn enables cloud mass to increase in the mixed-phase clouds."	https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16843-2021	2021-12-07	2022-03-07	"Lee, SS"	"Lee, SS[Lee, Seoung Soo]; Ha, KJ[Ha, Kyung-Ja]; Manoj, MG[Manoj, Manguttathil Gopalakrishnan]; Kamruzzaman, M[Kamruzzaman, Mohammad]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Zheng, YT[Zheng, Youtong]; Kim, BG[Kim, Byung-Gon]; Jung, CH[Jung, Chang Hoon]; Um, J[Um, Junshik]; Guo, JP[Guo, Jianping]; Choi, KO[Choi, Kyoung Ock]; Kim, GU[Kim, Go-Un]"	13	KAIST	7.197	2.532	5.00	Y	Article

This oscillation is evident in multiple historical climate records, some more than a century long, and appears to be continuing. Analysis shows that this 5-7 year oscillation is linked to a sequence of anomalous large-scale climate patterns with an eastward propagation in both the ocean and atmosphere. While warmer temperature emerges from the northern central Pacific to the west coast of California, La Nina pattern develops simultaneously, implying that the lifecycle of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation that takes multiple years to form could be a trigger. The evolving patterns of the Pacific-to-North America atmospheric teleconnection suggest the role of tropical and subtropical forcing embedded in this lifecycle.

Streamflow generally plays a role in the horizontal redistribution of heat, and thermal exchange in lakes predominantly occurs in a vertical direction. However, numerical models simulate the water temperature for uncoupled rivers and lakes, and the linkages between them on a global scale remain unclear. In this study, we proposed an integrated modeling framework: Tightly Coupled framework for Hydrology of Open water Interactions in River-lake network (TCHOIR, read as ""tee quire""). The objective is to simulate terrestrial fluvial and thermodynamics as a continuum of mass and energy in solid and liquid phases redistributed among rivers and lakes. TCHOIR uses high-resolution geographical information harmonized over fluvial and lacustrine networks. The results have been validated through comparison with in situ observations and satellite-based data products, and the model sensitivity has been tested with multiple meteorological forcing datasets. It was observed that the ""coupled"" mode outperformed the ""river-only"" mode in terms of discharge and temperature downstream of lakes; moreover, it was observed that seasonal and interannual variation in lake water levels and temperature are also more reliable in the ""coupled"" mode. The inclusion of lakes in the coupled model resulted in an increase in river temperatures during winter at midlatitudes and a decrease in temperatures during summer at high latitudes, which reflects the role of lakes as a form of large heat storage. The river-lake coupling framework presented herein provides a basis for further elucidating the role of terrestrial surface water in Earth's energy cycle."	https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5669-2021	2021-09-24	2022-01-10	"Tokuda, D"	"Tokuda, D[Tokuda, Daisuke]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Yamazaki, D[Yamazaki, Dai]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	4	KAIST	6.892	2.529	5.00	Y	Article

As randomly initialized weights are updated during back-propagation using the gradient descent procedure under a given loss function, the loss function structure can affect the performance significantly. In this study, we considered the distribution error, i.e., the inconsistency of two distributions (those of the predicted values and label), as the prediction error, and proposed weighted empirical stretching (WES) as a novel loss function to increase the overlap area of the two distributions. The function depends on the distribution of a given label, thus, it is applicable to any distribution shape. Moreover, it contains a scaling hyperparameter (beta) such that the appropriate parameter value maximizes the common section of the two distributions. To test the function capability, we generated ideal distributed curves (unimodal, skewed unimodal, bimodal, and skewed bimodal) as the labels, and used the Fourier-extracted input data from the curves under a feedforward neural network. In general, WES outperformed loss functions in wide use, and the performance was robust to the various noise levels. The improved results in RMSE for the extreme domain (i.e., both tail regions of the distribution) are expected to be utilized for prediction of abnormal events in non-linear complex systems such as natural disaster and financial crisis.

This imposes a challenge for modeling leaf phenology and photosynthesis seasonality in land surface models (LSMs) across Amazonian evergreen forest biome. On continental scale, we tested two climatic triggers suggested by site observations, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and short-wave incoming radiation (SW) for defining leaf shedding and incorporated VPD- and SW-triggered new canopy phenology modules in the ORCHIDEE LSM (hereafter VPD-AP and SW-AP versions). Our results show that both VPD and SW are plausible precursors of large scale litterfall seasonality across the basin by comparing against in situ data from 14 sites. Specially, both VPD-AP and SW-AP correctly capture the increases in litterfall during the early dry season, followed by a flush of new leaves with increasing photosynthetic rates during the later dry season. The VPD-AP version performs better than the SW-AP version in capturing a dry-season increase of photosynthesis across the wet Amazonia areas where mean annual precipitation exceeds 2,000 mm yr(-1), consistent with previous satellite data analysis. Both VPD-AP and SW-AP model versions perform well in northern, central and southern Amazon regions where the SW seasonality is unimodal, but miss the seasonality of satellite GPP proxies in the eastern region off the coast of Guyana shield where SW seasonality is bimodal. Our findings imply that atmospheric dryness and sunlight availability likely explain the seasonality of leaf shedding and leaf flush processes, respectively, and consequently control canopy photosynthesis in Amazonian evergreen forests."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gb006893	2023-01-06	2023-01-06	"Chen, X"	"Chen, X[Chen, Xiuzhi]; Ciais, P[Ciais, Philippe]; Maignan, F[Maignan, Fabienne]; Zhang, Y[Zhang, Yuan]; Bastos, A[Bastos, Ana]; Liu, L[Liu, Liyang]; Bacour, C[Bacour, Cédric]; Fan, L[Fan, Lei]; Gentine, P[Gentine, Pierre]; Goll, D[Goll, Daniel]; Green, J[Green, Julia]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Li, L[Li, Laurent]; Liu, Y[Liu, Yi]; Peng, S[Peng, Shushi]; Tang, H[Tang, Hao]; Viovy, N[Viovy, Nicolas]; Wigneron, JP[Wigneron, Jean‐Pierre]; Wu, J[Wu, Jin]; Yuan, W[Yuan, Wenping]; Zhang, H[Zhang, Haicheng]"	21	타기관	6.500	2.194	4.67	N	Article

While historical TWS variations have been increasingly studied, future changes in TWS and the linkages to droughts remain unexamined. Here, using ensemble hydrological simulations, we show that climate change could reduce TWS in many regions, especially those in the Southern Hemisphere. Strong inter-ensemble agreement indicates high confidence in the projected changes that are driven primarily by climate forcing rather than land and water management activities. Declines in TWS translate to increases in future droughts. By the late twenty-first century, the global land area and population in extreme-to-exceptional TWS drought could more than double, each increasing from 3% during 1976-2005 to 7% and 8%, respectively.

Our findings do not support the hypothesis advanced by previous snow MIPs: evaluating models against more variables and providing evaluation datasets extended temporally and spatially does not facilitate identification of key new processes requiring improvement to model snow mass and energy budgets, even at point scales. In fact, the same modeling issues identified by previous snow MIPs arose: albedo is a major source of uncertainty, surface exchange parameterizations are problematic, and individual model performance is inconsistent. This lack of progress is attributed partly to the large number of human errors that led to anomalous model behavior and to numerous resubmissions. It is unclear how widespread such errors are in our field and others; dedicated time and resources will be needed to tackle this issue to prevent highly sophisticated models and their research outputs from being vulnerable because of avoidable human mistakes. The design of and the data available to successive snow MIPs were also questioned. Evaluation of models against bulk snow properties was found to be sufficient for some but inappropriate for more complex snow models whose skills at simulating internal snow properties remained untested. Discussions between the authors of this paper on the purpose of MIPs revealed varied, and sometimes contradictory, motivations behind their participation. These findings started a collaborative effort to adapt future snow MIPs to respond to the diverse needs of the community."	https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0329.1	2022-12-07	2023-04-05	"Menard, CB"	"Menard, CB[Menard, Cecile B.]; Essery, R[Essery, Richard]; Krinner, G[Krinner, Gerhard]; Arduini, G[Arduini, Gabriele]; Bartlett, P[Bartlett, Paul]; Boone, A[Boone, Aaron]; Brutel-Vuilmet, C[Brutel-Vuilmet, Claire]; Burke, E[Burke, Eleanor]; Cuntz, M[Cuntz, Matthias]; Dai, Y[Dai, Yongjiu]; Decharme, B[Decharme, Bertrand]; Dutra, E[Dutra, Emanuel]; Fang, X[Fang, Xing]; Fierz, C[Fierz, Charles]; Gusev, Y[Gusev, Yeugeniy]; Hagemann, S[Hagemann, Stefan]; Haverd, V[Haverd, Vanessa]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Lafaysse, M[Lafaysse, Matthieu]; Marke, T[Marke, Thomas]; Nasonova, O[Nasonova, Olga]; Nitta, T[Nitta, Tomoko]; Niwano, M[Niwano, Masashi]; Pomeroy, J[Pomeroy, John]; Schaedler, G[Schaedler, Gerd]; Semenov, VA[Semenov, Vladimir A.]; Smirnova, T[Smirnova, Tatiana]; Strasser, U[Strasser, Ulrich]; Swenson, S[Swenson, Sean]; Turkov, D[Turkov, Dmitry]; Wever, N[Wever, Nander]; Yuan, H[Yuan, Hua]"	32	타기관	9.116	2.471	5.00	N	Article

However, almost all validation studies for such precipitation estimation have focused only on the surface precipitation rate. This study investigates the vertical precipitation profiles estimated by two passive MW-based retrieval algorithms, i.e., the emissivity principal components (EPC) algorithm and the Goddard profiling algorithm (GPROF). The passive MW-based condensed water content profiles estimated from the Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI) are validated using the GMI 1 Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar combined algorithm as the reference product. It is shown that the EPC generally underestimates the magnitude of the condensed water content profiles, described by the mean condensed water content, by about 20%-50% in the middle-to-high latitudes, while GPROF overestimates it by about 20%-50% in the middle-to-high latitudes and more than 50% in the tropics. Part of the EPC magnitude biases is associated with the representation of the precipitation type (i.e., convective and stratiform) in the retrieval algorithm. This suggests that a separate technique for precipitation type identification would aid in mitigating these biases. In contrast to the magnitude of the profile, the profile shapes are relatively well represented by these two passive MW-based retrievals. The joint analysis between the estimation performances of the vertical profiles and surface precipitation rate shows that the physically reasonable connections between the surface precipitation rate and the associated vertical profiles are achieved to some extent by the passive MW-based algorithms."	https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0160.1	2021-07-13	2022-03-07	"Utsumi, N"	"Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Turk, FJ[Turk, F.

Annual snow cover durations differ widely between models, but interannual variations are strongly correlated because of the common driving data. No significant trends are observed in starting dates for seasonal snow cover, but there are significant trends towards snow cover ending earlier at two of the sites in observations and most of the models. A simplified model with just two parameters controlling solar radiation and sensible heat contributions to snowmelt spans the ranges of snow cover durations and trends. This model predicts that sites where snow persists beyond annual peaks in solar radiation and air temperature will experience rapid decreases in snow cover duration with warming as snow begins to melt earlier and at times of year with more energy available for melting."	https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4687-2020	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Essery, R"	"Essery, R[Essery, Richard]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Wang, LB[Wang, Libo]; Bartlett, P[Bartlett, Paul]; Boone, A[Boone, Aaron]; Brutel-Vuilmet, C[Brutel-Vuilmet, Claire]; Burke, E[Burke, Eleanor]; Cuntz, M[Cuntz, Matthias]; Decharme, B[Decharme, Bertrand]; Dutra, E[Dutra, Emanuel]; Fang, X[Fang, Xing]; Gusev, Y[Gusev, Yeugeniy]; Hagemann, S[Hagemann, Stefan]; Haverd, V[Haverd, Vanessa]; Kontu, A[Kontu, Anna]; Krinner, G[Krinner, Gerhard]; Lafaysse, M[Lafaysse, Matthieu]; Lejeune, Y[Lejeune, Yves]; Marke, T[Marke, Thomas]; Marks, D[Marks, Danny]; Marty, C[Marty, Christoph]; Menard, CB[Menard, Cecile B.]; Nasonova, O[Nasonova, Olga]; Nitta, T[Nitta, Tomoko]; Pomeroy, J[Pomeroy, John]; Schadler, G[Schaedler, Gerd]; Semenov, V[Semenov, Vladimir]; Smirnova, T[Smirnova, Tatiana]; Swenson, S[Swenson, Sean]; Turkov, D[Turkov, Dmitry]; Wever, N[Wever, Nander]; Yuan, H[Yuan, Hua]"	32	타기관	5.771	2.574	5.00	Y	Article

According to the observation, the active and break phases of EASM have intensified resulting in a shorter but stronger rainy season, followed by a longer dry spell. This intensification in the active-phase precipitation is accompanied by increased lower tropospheric southwesterly wind and subsequent convergence of water vapor flux. These changes are accompanied by the widely reported westward extension of the North Pacific Subtropical High, which has been associated with the warming climate. CMIP6 models generally underestimated the observed intensification of the EASM lifecycle and the monsoon precipitation. However, some of the models did simulate the intensified EASM lifecycle similar to that observed. The result highlights the reasonable performance on EASM shown in some CMIP6 models and those simulations lend support to a dynamically-driven intensification of the EASM lifecycle in the warmer climate."	https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab9b3f	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Park, J"	"Park, J[Park, Jina]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Wang, SYS[Simon Wang, S-Y]; Jeong, JH[Jeong, Jee-Hoon]; Lim, KS[Lim, Kyo-Sun]; LaPlante, M[LaPlante, Matthew]; Yoon, JH[Yoon, Jin-Ho]"	7	타기관	6.8	2.37	5.00	Y	Article

However, there are few comprehensive studies on the related risks with regard to the differences between relatively weak levels of warming, including the recent targets of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C. The present study investigates the impacts of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming on aridification and their non-linearity based on the relationship between available water and energy at the Earth's terrestrial surface. Large multi-model ensembles with a 4000-model-year in total are sourced from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis, and Projected Impacts (HAPPI) project. Results demonstrate that 2 degrees C warming results in more frequent dry states in the Amazon Basin, western Europe, and southern Africa, and a limited warming to 1.5 degrees C will mitigate aridification and increase the frequency of extreme dry-year in these regions. In the Mediterranean region, a significant acceleration of aridification is found from the 1.5 degrees C to 2 degrees C warming projections, which indicates a need to limit the warming by 1.5 degrees C. A substantial portion of Asia is projected to become increasingly humid under both 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming scenarios. In some geographic regions, such as Australia, a strong nonlinear shift of aridification is found as 2 degrees C warming results in shift to wetter state contrast to significant increases in aridity and dry-year frequency at the weaker level of warming. The results suggest that the responses of regional precipitation to global warming cause the aridity changes, but their nonlinear behaviors along with different warming levels should be assessed carefully, in particular, to incorporate the additional 0.5 degrees C warming."	https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab9db3	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Takeshima, A"	"Takeshima, A[Takeshima, Akira]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Shiogama, H[Shiogama, Hideo]; Lierhammer, L[Lierhammer, Ludwig]; Scinocca, JF[Scinocca, John F.]; Seland, O[Seland, Oyvind]; Mitchell, D[Mitchell, Dann]"	7	타기관	6.8	2.37	5.00	Y	Article

Human-induced climate change impacts the hydrological cycle and thus the availability of water resources. However, previous assessments of observed warming-induced changes in dryness have not excluded natural climate variability and show conflicting results due to uncertainties in our understanding of the response of evapotranspiration. Here we employ data-driven and land-surface models to produce observation-based global reconstructions of water availability from 1902 to 2014, a period during which our planet experienced a global warming of approximately 1 degrees C. Our analysis reveals a spatial pattern of changes in average water availability during the driest month of the year over the past three decades compared with the first half of the twentieth century, with some regions experiencing increased and some decreased water availability. The global pattern is consistent with climate model estimates that account for anthropogenic effects, and it is not expected from natural climate variability, supporting human-induced climate change as the cause. There is regional evidence of drier dry seasons predominantly in extratropical latitudes and including Europe, western North America, northern Asia, southern South America, Australia and eastern Africa.

A particular advantage of this database is its wide coverage of multiple data sources at different hierarchical and temporal scales, together with environmental driving data as well as the latest climate scenarios. Specifically, the PROFOUND DB provides general site descriptions, soil, climate, CO2, nitrogen deposition, tree and forest stand level, and remote sensing data for nine contrasting forest stands distributed across Europe. Moreover, for a subset of five sites, time series of carbon fluxes, atmospheric heat conduction and soil water are also available. The climate and nitrogen deposition data contain several datasets for the historic period and a wide range of future climate change scenarios following the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5). We also provide pre-industrial climate simulations that allow for model runs aimed at disentangling the contribution of climate change to observed forest productivity changes.

It also has been mentioned in UN Sustainable Development Goals 6 to ensure that all people will have equal access to both water and sanitation service, as well as embedded in Goal 10 that aims to reduce inequality and promoting inclusiveness. However, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme 2017 reported that 844 million people are still living without basic access to water, and 2.3 billion are still excluded from basic sanitation service. In this study, we present quantitative global-scale analysis of inequality of accessing the water and sanitation services from different wealth groups in 82 developing countries. We found that access inequality is rampant among developing countries particularly in terms of accessing basic sanitation service which the poor populations tend to be excluded in accessing the basic service. Based on combined multiple global data sets, we further identify which components of water governance are the key contributors to access inequality in water and sanitation services. We conclude that social and political dimension of water governance, such as government effectiveness, are influencing the occurrence of inequality of access to sanitation service in developing countries, while the inequality of access to basic water service was strongly influenced by the economic aspect of water governance, such as absorption of aid funds. Plain Language Summary Access to basic water service and basic sanitation service has been acknowledged as fundamental human rights, and all people should have equal access to both water and sanitation service. Despite being placed in such important goals, a considerable number of people still facing difficulties from accessing to basic service. We present first analysis of inequality of accessing the water and sanitation services from different wealth groups in developing countries. We found that inequality is rampant among developing countries particularly in term of accessing basic sanitation service which the poor populations tend to be excluded in accessing the basic service.

By its action on water cycle, irrigation affects water resources and local climate. In this study, a new irrigation module, including flood and paddy irrigation technologies, was developed in the ORCHIDEE-CROP land surface model which describes crop phenology and growth in order to estimate irrigation demands over China from 1982 to 2014. Three simulations were performed including NI (no irrigation), IR (with irrigation limited by local water resources), and FI (with irrigation demand fulfilled). Observations and census data were used to validate the simulations. Results showed that the estimated irrigation water withdrawal (W) based on IR and FI scenarios bracket statisticalW with fair spatial agreements (r = 0.68 +/- 0.07; p < 0.01). Improving irrigation efficiency was found to be the dominant factor leading to the observedW decrease. By comparing simulated total water storage (TWS) with GRACE observations, we found that simulated TWS with irrigation well explained the TWS variation over China. However, our simulation overestimated the seasonality of TWS in the Yangtze River Basin due to ignoring regulation of artificial reservoirs. The observed TWS decrease in the Yellow River Basin caused by groundwater depletion was not totally captured in our simulation, but it can be inferred by combining simulated TWS with census data. Moreover, we demonstrated that land use change tended to drive W locally but had little effect on total W over China due to water resources limitation."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001770	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Yin, Z"	"Yin, Z[Yin, Z.]; Wang, XH[Wang, X.

Yet the hydrological processes that govern groundwater recharge and sustainability-and their sensitivity to climatic variability-are poorly constrained(4,5). Given the absence of firm observational constraints, it remains to be seen whether model-based projections of decreased water resources in dry parts of the region(4) are justified. Here we show, through analysis of multidecadal groundwater hydrographs across sub-Saharan Africa, that levels of aridity dictate the predominant recharge processes, whereas local hydrogeology influences the type and sensitivity of precipitation-recharge relationships. Recharge in some humid locations varies by as little as five per cent (by coefficient of variation) across a wide range of annual precipitation values. Other regions, by contrast, show roughly linear precipitation-recharge relationships, with precipitation thresholds (of roughly ten millimetres or less per day) governing the initiation of recharge. These thresholds tend to rise as aridity increases, and recharge in drylands is more episodic and increasingly dominated by focused recharge through losses from ephemeral overland flows. Extreme annual recharge is commonly associated with intense rainfall and flooding events, themselves often driven by large-scale climate controls. Intense precipitation, even during years of lower overall precipitation, produces some of the largest years of recharge in some dry subtropical locations. Our results therefore challenge the 'high certainty' consensus regarding decreasing water resources(4) in such regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The potential resilience of groundwater to climate variability in many areas that is revealed by these precipitation-recharge relationships is essential for informing reliable predictions of climate-change impacts and adaptation strategies."	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1441-7	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Cuthbert, MO"	"Cuthbert, MO[Cuthbert, Mark O.]; Taylor, RG[Taylor, Richard G.]; Favreau, G[Favreau, Guillaume]; Todd, MC[Todd, Martin C.]; Shamsudduha, M[Shamsudduha, Mohammad]; Villholth, KG[Villholth, Karen G.]; MacDonald, AM[MacDonald, Alan M.]; Scanlon, BR[Scanlon, Bridget R.]; Kotchoni, DOV[Kotchoni, D.

The long-term datasets (one maritime, one arctic, three boreal, and five mid-latitude alpine) are the reference sites chosen for evaluating models participating in the Earth System Model-Snow Model Intercomparison Project. Periods covered by the in situ data vary between 7 and 20 years of hourly meteorological data, with evaluation data (snow depth, snow water equivalent, albedo, soil temperature, and surface temperature) available at varying temporal intervals. Thirty-year (1980-2010) time series have been extracted from a global gridded surface meteorology dataset (Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3) for the grid cells containing the reference sites, interpolated to 1 h time steps and bias-corrected. Although the correction was applied to all sites, it was most important for mountain sites hundreds of metres higher than the grid elevations and for which uncorrected air temperatures were too high and snowfall amounts too low. The discussion considers the importance of data sharing to the identification of errors and how the publication of these datasets contributes to good practice, consistency, and reproducibility in geosciences. The Supplement provides information on instrumentation, an estimate of the percentages of missing values, and gap-filling methods at each site. It is hoped that these datasets will be used as benchmarks for future model development and that their ease of use and availability will help model developers quantify model uncertainties and reduce model errors.

Seasonal inundations modify this local scenery affecting, consequently, the local circulations. However, this effect has not properly been investigated yet. Thus, we carried out numerical experiments for a river breeze case to investigate the seasonal flooding effect on the river breeze and detail the processes involved in the river breeze development. In the numerical experiments, we ran the Catchment-Based Macro-scale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood) model to simulate flooding depth and extent and used the CaMa-Flood outputs to force the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model. The seasonal flooding alters the surface energy partitioning causing a temperature decrease over the river region and intensification of the river breezes in the daytime. The intensified river breezes propagate more rapidly through the upland region, take longer to dissipate and promote stronger upward vertical motion altering the heat and mass transport. These novel findings are fundamentally important to the understanding of the local climate variability of the central Amazon. We can infer that river breezes and its consequence to local climate are less (more) pronounced in drought (wet) years."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JD029439	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Santos, MJ"	"Santos, MJ[Santos, Mercel J.]; Medvigy, D[Medvigy, David]; Dias, MAFS[Silva Dias, Maria A.

This study proposes a novel idea to estimate subhourly time-averaged surface rain rate based on the instantaneous vertical rain profile observed from low-Earth-orbiting satellites. Instantaneous rain estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) are compared with 1-min surface rain gauges in North America and Kwajalein atoll for the warm seasons of 2005-14. Time-lagged correlation analysis between PR rain rates at various height levels and surface rain gauge data shows that the peak of the correlations tends to be delayed for PR rain at higher levels up to around 6-km altitude. PR estimates for low to middle height levels have better correlations with time-delayed surface gauge data than the PR's estimated surface rain rate product. This implies that rain estimates for lower to middle heights may have skill to estimate the eventual surface rain rate that occurs 1-30 min later. Therefore, in this study, the vertical profiles of TRMM PR instantaneous rain estimates are averaged between the surface and various heights above the surface to represent time-averaged surface rain rate. It was shown that vertically averaged PR estimates up to middle heights (4.5 km) exhibit better skill, compared to the PR estimated instantaneous surface rain product, to represent subhourly (30 min) time-averaged surface rain rate. These findings highlight the merit of additional consideration of vertical rain profiles, not only instantaneous surface rain rate, to improve subhourly surface estimates of satellite-based rain products."	https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0225.1	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Utsumi, N"	"Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Turk, FJ[Turk, F.

Here, we investigate the event-to-event hydroclimatic intensity, where an event is a pair of adjacent wet and dry spells, under future warming scenarios. According to a set of targeted multi-model large ensemble experiments, event-wise intensification will significantly increase globally for an additional 0.5 degrees C warming beyond 1.5 degrees C. In high latitudinal regions of the North American continent and Eurasia, this intensification is likely to involve overwhelming increases in wet spell intensity. Western and Eastern North America will likely experience more intense wet spells with negligible changes of dry spells. For the Mediterranean region, enhancement of dry spells seems to be dominating compared to the decrease in wet spell strength, and this will lead to an overall event-wise intensification. Furthermore, the extreme intensification could be 10 times stronger than the mean intensification. The high damage potential of such drastic changes between flood and drought conditions poses a major challenge to adaptation, and the findings suggest that risks could be substantially reduced by achieving a 1.5 degrees C target."	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-39936-2	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Madakumbura, GD"	"Madakumbura, GD[Madakumbura, Gavin D.]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Shiogama, H[Shiogama, Hideo]; Fischer, EM[Fischer, Erich M.]; Seland, O[Seland, Oyvind]; Scinocca, JF[Scinocca, John F.]; Mitchell, DM[Mitchell, Daniel M.]; Hirabayashi, Y[Hirabayashi, Yukiko]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	10	타기관	3.998	1.341	4.00	Y	Article

Here we test, for the first time, systematically across many important systems, how well such impact models capture the impacts of extreme climate conditions. Using the 2003 European heat wave and drought as a historical analogue for comparable events in the future, we find that a majority of models underestimate the extremeness of impacts in important sectors such as agriculture, terrestrial ecosystems, and heat-related human mortality, while impacts on water resources and hydropower are overestimated in some river basins; and the spread across models is often large. This has important implications for economic assessments of climate change impacts that rely on these models.

The model considers fluvial dynamics such as floodplain inundation and as well simulates seasonal freeze-thaw cycles for temperate and arctic rivers, and it was found that proposed physically based parameterizations appropriately reproduced in situ observed seasonal variations in 12 global rivers. Theoretically, floodplain inundation has two major effects on water temperature variability: (1) broadening of water surfaces, which increases heat exchange with the atmosphere and friction with river bed, and (2) shallowing mean water depth, which increases the absorption rate of shortwave radiation per unit volume. In contrast to the broadening which affects both warming and cooling processes, the shallowing causes warming only and has dominant impacts mainly during the ice melting season in Arctic regions and the rainy season in the tropics. Furthermore, it was revealed that lateral mixing between channel and floodplain has a significant impact on determination of river water temperature. Although water temperature plays an important role in water quality and riverine material circulation linking terrestrial and coastal environments, it has not been considered in most Earth system models. The improvements in global-scale river water temperature modeling demonstrated in this study will benefit for future Earth systems research."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023083	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Tokuda, D"	"Tokuda, D[Tokuda, Daisuke]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Yamazaki, D[Yamazaki, Dai]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	4	타기관	4.309	1.799	4.67	Y	Article

In this study, we evaluate the terrestrial water budget of the Donga basin (Benin, West Africa), as simulated by three land surface models (LSMs) used in the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis Land Surface Model Intercomparison Project, phase 2 (ALMIP2): CLM4, Catchment LSM (CLSM), and Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO). All three models include an unconfined groundwater component and are driven by the same ALMIP2 atmospheric forcing from 2005 to 2008. Results show that all three models simulate substantially shallower water table depth (WTD) with smaller seasonal variations, approximately 1-1.5 m compared to the observed values that range between 4 and 9.6 m, while the seasonal variations of GWS are overestimated by all the models. These seemingly contradictory simulation results can be explained by the overly high specific yield prescribed in all models. All models achieve similar GWS simulations but with different fractions of precipitation partitioning into surface runoff, base flow, and evapotranspiration (ET), suggesting high uncertainty and errors in the terrestrial and groundwater budgets among models. The poor performances of models can be attributed to bias in the hydrological partitioning (base flow vs surface runoff) and sparse subsurface data. This analysis confirms the importance of subsurface hydrological processes in the current generation of LSMs and calls for substantial improvement in both surface water budget (which controls groundwater recharge) and the groundwater system (hydrodynamic parameters, vertical geometry)."	https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0025.1	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Rashid, M"	"Rashid, M[Rashid, Mehnaz]; Chien, RY[Chien, Rong-You]; Ducharne, A[Ducharne, Agnes]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Yeh, PJF[Yeh, Pat J. -F.]; Peugeot, C[Peugeot, Christophe]; Boone, A[Boone, Aaron]; He, XG[He, Xiaogang]; Seguis, L[Seguis, Luc]; Yabu, Y[Yabu, Yutaro]; Boukari, M[Boukari, Moussa]; Lo, MH[Lo, Min-Hui]"	12	타기관	3.891	2.101	4.00	Y	Article

In this study, we demonstrate that the parameterization of capillary flux significantly affects the magnitude of GW-supported ET (15%) and GW recharge (25%). The largest sensitivities are associated with a strong dependence of the capillary flux parameterization on water table depth (WTD) with further controls by soil hydraulic properties. Under shallow WTD condition, the finer soils show a larger GW-supported ET for parameterization that depends only on WTD. Further, GW-supported ET reduces by 7-13% per meter increase in interaction depth used in simulation compared to simulation in which the interaction depth varies in space and time with WTD. The simulations of runoff, soil moisture, and WTD are even more sensitive to the difference in parameterization and interaction depth. Moreover, these sensitivities vary largely in both space and time. Evaluations against observation-based data and previous modeling simulations reveal that simulations with capillary flux perform better than that the one without it in regions with large GW-supported ET. We concur that capillary flux has a large and nonnegligible influence in global hydrologic simulation. But, the spatiotemporal variabilities of sensitivities of hydrological fluxes and storages demonstrate that different parameterization of GW capillary flux may also lead to a substantial uncertainty in global hydrologic simulations and subsequent water resources assessments."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023434	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Koirala, S"	"Koirala, S[Koirala, Sujan]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Hirabayashi, Y[Hirabayashi, Yukiko]; Kanae, S[Kanae, Shinjiro]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	5	타기관	4.309	1.799	4.67	Y	Article

Although it is not part of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), ESM-SnowMIP is tightly linked to the CMIP6-endorsed Land Surface, Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison (LS3MIP)."	https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-5027-2018	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Krinner, G"	"Krinner, G[Krinner, Gerhard]; Derksen, C[Derksen, Chris]; Essery, R[Essery, Richard]; Flanner, M[Flanner, Mark]; Hagemann, S[Hagemann, Stefan]; Clark, M[Clark, Martyn]; Hall, A[Hall, Alex]; Rott, H[Rott, Helmut]; Brutel-Vuilmet, C[Brutel-Vuilmet, Claire]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Menard, CB[Menard, Cecile B.]; Mudryk, L[Mudryk, Lawrence]; Thackeray, C[Thackeray, Chad]; Wang, LB[Wang, Libo]; Arduini, G[Arduini, Gabriele]; Balsamo, G[Balsamo, Gianpaolo]; Bartlett, P[Bartlett, Paul]; Boike, J[Boike, Julia]; Boone, A[Boone, Aaron]; Cheruy, F[Cheruy, Frederique]; Colin, J[Colin, Jeanne]; Cuntz, M[Cuntz, Matthias]; Dai, Y[Dai, Yongjiu]; Decharme, B[Decharme, Bertrand]; Derry, J[Derry, Jeff]; Ducharne, A[Ducharne, Agnes]; Dutra, E[Dutra, Emanuel]; Fang, X[Fang, Xing]; Fierz, C[Fierz, Charles]; Ghattas, J[Ghattas, Josephine]; Gusev, Y[Gusev, Yeugeniy]; Haverd, V[Haverd, Vanessa]; Kontu, A[Kontu, Anna]; Lafaysse, M[Lafaysse, Matthieu]; Law, R[Law, Rachel]; Lawrence, D[Lawrence, Dave]; Li, W[Li, Weiping]; Marke, T[Marke, Thomas]; Marks, D[Marks, Danny]; Menegoz, M[Menegoz, Martin]; Nasonova, O[Nasonova, Olga]; Nitta, T[Nitta, Tomoko]; Niwano, M[Niwano, Masashi]; Pomeroy, J[Pomeroy, John]; Raleigh, MS[Raleigh, Mark S.]; Schaedler, G[Schaedler, Gerd]; Semenov, V[Semenov, Vladimir]; Smirnova, TG[Smirnova, Tanya G.]; Stacke, T[Stacke, Tobias]; Strasser, U[Strasser, Ulrich]; Svenson, S[Svenson, Sean]; Turkov, D[Turkov, Dmitry]; Wang, T[Wang, Tao]; Wever, N[Wever, Nander]; Yuan, H[Yuan, Hua]; Zhou, W[Zhou, Wenyan]; Zhu, D[Zhu, Dan]"	57	타기관	5.154	3.164	5.00	Y	Article

The errors may come from the model itself (structure and parameterization) but also from the meteorological forcing used. In order to separate the two source of errors, four atmospheric forcing datasets, GSWP3 (Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3), PGF (Princeton Global meteorological Forcing), CRU-NCEP (Climatic Research Unit-National Center for Environmental Prediction), and WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis data), were used to drive simulations in China by the land surface model ORCHIDEE-MICT(ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms: aMeliorated Interactions between Carbon and Temperature). Simulated soil moisture was compared with in situ and satellite datasets at different spatial and temporal scales in order to (1) estimate the ability of ORCHIDEE-MICT to represent soil moisture dynamics in China; (2) demonstrate the most suitable forcing dataset for further hydrological studies in Yangtze and Yellow River basins; and (3) understand the discrepancies of simulated soil moisture among simulations. Results showed that ORCHIDEE-MICT can simulate reasonable soil moisture dynamics in China, but the quality varies with forcing data. Simulated soil moisture driven by GSWP3 and WFDEI shows the best performance according to the root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient, respectively, suggesting that both GSWP3 and WFDEI are good choices for further hydrological studies in the two catchments. The mismatch between simulated and observed soil moisture is mainly explained by the bias of magnitude, suggesting that the parameterization in ORCHIDEE-MICT should be revised for further simulations in China. Underestimated soil moisture in the North China Plain demonstrates possible significant impacts of human activities like irrigation on soil moisture variation, which was not considered in our simulations. Finally, the discrepancies of meteorological variables and simulated soil moisture among the four simulations are analyzed. The result shows that the discrepancy of soil moisture is mainly explained by differences in precipitation frequency and air humidity rather than differences in precipitation amount."	https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5463-2018	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Yin, Z"	"Yin, Z[Yin, Zun]; Ottle, C[Ottle, Catherine]; Ciais, P[Ciais, Philippe]; Guimberteau, M[Guimberteau, Matthieu]; Wang, XH[Wang, Xuhui]; Zhu, D[Zhu, Dan]; Maignan, F[Maignan, Fabienne]; Peng, SS[Peng, Shushi]; Piao, SL[Piao, Shilong]; Polcher, J[Polcher, Jan]; Zhou, F[Zhou, Feng]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	12	타기관	4.936	2.134	5.00	Y	Article

However, recently available ET products show persistent uncertainties that are impeding a precise attribution of human-induced climate change. Here, we aim at comparing a range of independent global monthly land ET estimates with historical model simulations from the global water, agriculture, and biomes sectors participating in the second phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2a). Among the independent estimates, we use the EartH2Observe Tier-1 dataset (E2O), two commonly used reanalyses, a pre-compiled ensemble product (LandFlux-EVAL), and an updated collection of recently published datasets that algorithmically derive ET from observations or observations-based estimates (diagnostic datasets). A cluster analysis is applied in order to identify spatio-temporal differences among all datasets and to thus identify factors that dominate overall uncertainties. The clustering is controlled by several factors including the model choice, the meteorological forcing used to drive the assessed models, the data category (models participating in the different sectors of ISIMIP2a, E2O models, diagnostic estimates, reanalysis-based estimates or composite products), the ET scheme, and the number of soil layers in the models. By using these factors to explain spatial and spatio-temporal variabilities in ET, we find that the model choice mostly dominates (24%-40% of variance explained), except for spatio-temporal patterns of total ET, where the forcing explains the largest fraction of the variance (29%). The most dominant clusters of datasets are further compared with individual diagnostic and reanalysis-based estimates to assess their representation of selected heat waves and droughts in the Great Plains, Central Europe and western Russia. Although most of the ET estimates capture these extreme events, the generally large spread among the entire ensemble indicates substantial uncertainties."	https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aac4bb	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Wartenburger, R"	"Wartenburger, R[Wartenburger, Richard]; Seneviratne, SI[Seneviratne, Sonia, I]; Hirschi, M[Hirschi, Martin]; Chang, JF[Chang, Jinfeng]; Ciais, P[Ciais, Philippe]; Deryng, D[Deryng, Delphine]; Elliott, J[Elliott, Joshua]; Folberth, C[Folberth, Christian]; Gosling, SN[Gosling, Simon N.]; Gudmundsson, L[Gudmundsson, Lukas]; Henrot, AJ[Henrot, Alexandra-Jane]; Hickler, T[Hickler, Thomas]; Ito, A[Ito, Akihiko]; Khabarov, N[Khabarov, Nikolay]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Leng, GY[Leng, Guoyong]; Liu, JG[Liu, Junguo]; Liu, XC[Liu, Xingcai]; Masaki, Y[Masaki, Yoshimitsu]; Morfopoulos, C[Morfopoulos, Catherine]; Muller, C[Mueller, Christoph]; Schmied, HM[Schmied, Hannes Mueller]; Nishina, K[Nishina, Kazuya]; Orth, R[Orth, Rene]; Pokhrel, Y[Pokhrel, Yadu]; Pugh, TAM[Pugh, Thomas A.

It is found that the biases of the precipitation measurements are systematically associated with cloud types. The best agreements of passive microwave (PMW) products and infrared-based (IR) products with satellite radar-based estimates are found for a relatively weak precipitation range for mid-low clouds (except over land) and high clouds, while similar agreement is found for heavier precipitation range for deep convection regardless of surface type. Precipitation from mid-low clouds over land is considerably underestimated by PMW and IR products over almost the entire intensity range. The IR-based precipitation estimates for deep convective clouds considerably overestimate the intensity for both weak precipitation and cases where precipitation was not detected by the DPR-Ku algorithm. The findings reveal the characteristics of the biases of the products depend on the associated cloud types, which suggests consideration of the cloud type information to improve satellite-based precipitation estimates."	https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2018.2815590	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Utsumi, N"	"Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	2	타기관	3.534	1.518	4.00	Y	Article

Recent efforts to incorporate anthropogenic activities in these models have enabled more realistic comparisons with observations. Here we evaluate simulations from an ensemble of six models participating in the second phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project (ISIMIP2a). We simulate monthly runoff in 40 catchments, spatially distributed across eight global hydrobelts. The performance of each model and the ensemble mean is examined with respect to their ability to replicate observed mean and extreme runoff under human-influenced conditions. Application of a novel integrated evaluation metric to quantify the models' ability to simulate timeseries of monthly runoff suggests that the models generally perform better in the wetter equatorial and northern hydrobelts than in drier southern hydrobelts. When model outputs are temporally aggregated to assess mean annual and extreme runoff, the models perform better. Nevertheless, we find a general trend in the majority of models towards the overestimation of mean annual runoff and all indicators of upper and lower extreme runoff. The models struggle to capture the timing of the seasonal cycle, particularly in northern hydrobelts, while in southern hydrobelts the models struggle to reproduce the magnitude of the seasonal cycle. It is noteworthy that over all hydrological indicators, the ensemble mean fails to perform better than any individual model-a finding that challenges the commonly held perception that model ensemble estimates deliver superior performance over individual models. The study highlights the need for continued model development and improvement. It also suggests that caution should be taken when summarising the simulations from a model ensemble based upon its mean output."	https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aac547	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Zaherpour, J"	"Zaherpour, J[Zaherpour, Jamal]; Gosling, SN[Gosling, Simon N.]; Mount, N[Mount, Nick]; Schmied, HM[Schmied, Hannes Mueller]; Veldkamp, TIE[Veldkamp, Ted I.

With the recent international commitment to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees C, emission reductions need to be ambitious and could involve major land-use change (LUC). Land-based mitigation efforts to curb emissions growth include increasing terrestrial carbon sequestration through reforestation, or the adoption of bioenergy crops. These activities influence local climate through biogeophysical feedbacks, however, it is uncertain how important they are for a 1.5 degrees climate target. This was the motivation for HAPPI-Land: the half a degree additional warming, prognosis, and projected impactsland-use scenario experiment. Using four Earth system models, we present the first multimodel results from HAPPI-Land and demonstrate the critical role of land use for understanding the characteristics of regional climate extremes in low-emission scenarios. In particular, our results show that changes in temperature extremes due to LUC are comparable in magnitude to changes arising from half a degree of global warming. We also demonstrate that LUC contributes to more than 20% of the change in temperature extremes for large land areas concentrated over the Northern Hemisphere. However, we also identify sources of uncertainty that influence the multimodel consensus of our results including how LUC is implemented and the corresponding biogeophysical feedbacks that perturb climate. Therefore, our results highlight the urgent need to resolve the challenges in implementing LUC across models to quantify the impacts and consider how LUC contributes to regional changes in extremes associated with sustainable development pathways. Plain Language Summary The motivation for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report of 1.5 degrees C stems from the need to understand how the impacts of climate change may evolve for half a degree of global warming. Most low-emission scenarios involve substantial land-use change (LUC) including the expansion of bioenergy and food crops, as well as afforestation. Future emission scenarios used as input to climate models are derived using integrated assessment models, and focus on greenhouse gas emissions. However, changes in land use also have a direct effect on local climate through the local water and energy balances, which is not considered in these models, and therefore, our understanding on how dependent these climate projections are to the choice of land-use scenario is limited. Our study demonstrates that the land-use scenario has a considerable influence on the projections of temperature extremes for low-emission scenarios. In particular, for large land areas in the Northern Hemisphere, more than 20% of the change in temperature extremes can be attributed to LUC. However, our study also reveals that considerable uncertainty remains on what the feedbacks of land use may mean for land-based mitigation activities."	https://doi.org/10.1002/2017EF000744	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Hirsch, AL"	"Hirsch, AL[Hirsch, Annette L.]; Guillod, BP[Guillod, Benoit P.]; Seneviratne, SI[Seneviratne, Sonia I.]; Beyerle, U[Beyerle, Urs]; Boysen, LR[Boysen, Lena R.]; Brovkin, V[Brovkin, Victor]; Davin, EL[Davin, Edouard L.]; Doelman, JC[Doelman, Jonathan C.]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Mitchell, DM[Mitchell, Daniel M.]; Nitta, T[Nitta, Tomoko]; Shiogama, H[Shiogama, Hideo]; Sparrow, S[Sparrow, Sarah]; Stehfest, E[Stehfest, Elke]; van Vuuren, DP[van Vuuren, Detlef P.]; Wilson, S[Wilson, Simon]"	16	타기관	5.781		5.00	Y	Article

In order to improve the water storage estimates, previous studies assimilated terrestrial water storage variation (Delta TWS) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) into land surface models (LSMs). However, the GRACE-derived Delta TWS was generally computed from the high- level products (e.g. time-variable gravity fields, i.e. level 2, and land grid from the level 3 product). The gridded data products are subjected to several drawbacks such as signal attenuation and/or distortion caused by a posteriori filters and a lack of error covariance information. The post-processing of GRACE data might lead to the undesired alteration of the signal and its statistical property. This study uses the GRACE least- squares normal equation data to exploit the GRACE information rigorously and negate these limitations. Our approach combines GRACE's least- squares normal equation (obtained from ITSG-Grace2016 product) with the results from the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model to improve soil moisture and groundwater estimates. This study demonstrates, for the first time, an importance of using the GRACE raw data. The GRACE-combined (GC) approach is developed for optimal least- squares combination and the approach is applied to estimate the soil moisture and groundwater over 10 Australian river basins. The results are validated against the satellite soil moisture observation and the in situ groundwater data. Comparing to CABLE, we demonstrate the GC approach delivers evident improvement of water storage estimates, con-sistently from all basins, yielding better agreement on seasonal and inter-annual timescales. Significant improvement is found in groundwater storage while marginal improvement is observed in surface soil moisture estimates."	https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1811-2018	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Tangdamrongsub, N"	"Tangdamrongsub, N[Tangdamrongsub, Natthachet]; Han, SC[Han, Shin-Chan]; Decker, M[Decker, Mark]; Yeo, IY[Yeo, In-Young]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	5	타기관	4.936	2.134	5.00	Y	Article

At these latitudes, two carbon pools of planetary significance-those of the permanently frozen soils (permafrost), and of the great expanse of boreal forest are vulnerable to destabilization in the face of currently observed climatic warming, the speed and intensity of which are expected to increase with time. Improved projections of future Arctic and boreal ecosystem transformation require improved land surface models that integrate processes specific to these cold biomes. To this end, this study lays out rel-evant new parameterizations in the ORCHIDEE-MICT land surface model. These describe the interactions between soil carbon, soil temperature and hydrology, and their resulting feedbacks on water and CO2 fluxes, in addition to a recently developed fire module. Outputs from ORCHIDEE-MICT, when forced by two climate input datasets, are extensively evaluated against (i) temperature gradients between the atmosphere and deep soils, (ii) the hydrological components comprising the water balance of the largest high-latitude basins, and (iii) CO2 flux and carbon stock observations. The model performance is good with respect to empirical data, despite a simulated excessive plant water stress and a positive land surface temperature bias. In addition, acute model sensitivity to the choice of input forcing data suggests that the calibration of model parameters is strongly forcing-dependent. Overall, we suggest that this new model design is at the forefront of current efforts to reliably estimate future perturbations to the high-latitude terrestrial environment."	https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-121-2018	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Guimberteau, M"	"Guimberteau, M[Guimberteau, Matthieu]; Zhu, D[Zhu, Dan]; Maignan, F[Maignan, Fabienne]; Huang, Y[Huang, Ye]; Yue, C[Yue, Chao]; Dantec-Nedelec, S[Dantec-Nedelec, Sarah]; Ottle, C[Ottle, Catherine]; Jornet-Puig, A[Jornet-Puig, Albert]; Bastos, A[Bastos, Ana]; Laurent, P[Laurent, Pierre]; Goll, D[Goll, Daniel]; Bowring, S[Bowring, Simon]; Chang, JF[Chang, Jinfeng]; Guenet, B[Guenet, Bertrand]; Tifafi, M[Tifafi, Marwa]; Peng, SS[Peng, Shushi]; Krinner, G[Krinner, Gerhard]; Ducharne, A[Ducharne, Agnes]; Wang, FX[Wang, Fuxing]; Wang, T[Wang, Tao]; Wang, XH[Wang, Xuhui]; Wang, YL[Wang, Yilong]; Yin, Z[Yin, Zun]; Lauerwald, R[Lauerwald, Ronny]; Joetzjer, E[Joetzjer, Emilie]; Qiu, CJ[Qiu, Chunjing]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Ciais, P[Ciais, Philippe]"	28	타기관	5.154	3.164	5.00	Y	Article

After introducing early regional efforts to measure precipitation, the pioneering estimates of terrestrial mean precipitation from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are compared to successive estimates, including those using the latest gridded precipitation datasets available. The investigation reveals that the range of the early estimates is comparable to the interannual variation in terrestrial mean precipitation derived from the latest Climatic Research Unit (CRU) dataset. In-depth revisions of the estimates were infrequent up to the 1970s, due in part to difficulty obtaining and maintaining up-to-date datasets with global coverage. This point is illustrated in a family tree that identifies the key publications that subsequent authors referenced, sometimes decades after the original publication. Significant efforts to collate global observations facilitated new investigations and improved data exchange, for example, in the International Hydrological Decade (1965-74) and following the establishment of the Global Telecommunication System under the World Weather Watch Programme of the World Meteorological Organization. Also in the 1970s were the first attempts to adjust in situ observations on a global scale to account for gauge undercatch, and this had a noticeable impact on mean annual estimates. There remains no single satisfactory approach to gauge bias adjustment. Echoing the repeated message of past researchers, today's authors cite poor spatial coverage, temporal inhomogeneity, and inadequate sharing of in situ observations as the key obstacles to obtaining more accurate estimates of terrestrial mean precipitation."	https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0005.1	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Park, KJ"	"Park, KJ[Park, Kylie J.]; Yoshimura, K[Yoshimura, Kei]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	4	타기관	7.804	4.146	5.00	Y	Article

The seven processors, based on a neural network and band height, were assessed over an optically complex water body with Chla concentrations of 8.10-187.40 mg.m(-3) using 10-year MERIS archival data. These processors were adopted for the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor. Results indicated that the four processors of band height (i.e., the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI_L1); and Fluorescence Line Height (FLH_L1)); neural network (i.e., Eutrophic Lake (EUL); and Case 2 Regional (C2R)) possessed reasonable retrieval accuracy with root mean square error (R-2) in the range of 0.42-0.65. However, these processors underestimated the retrieved Chla > 100 mg.m(-3), reflecting the limitation of the band height processors to eliminate the influence of non-phytoplankton matter and highlighting the need to train the neural network for highly turbid waters. MCI_L1 outperformed other processors during the calibration and validation stages (R-2 = 0.65, Root mean square error (RMSE) = 22.18 mg.m(-3), the mean absolute relative error (MARE) = 36.88%). In contrast, the results from the Boreal Lake (BOL) and Free University of Berlin (FUB) processors demonstrated their inadequacy to accurately retrieve Chla concentration > 50 mg.m(-3), mainly due to the limitation of the training datasets that resulted in a high MARE for BOL (56.20%) and FUB (57.00%). Mapping the spatial distribution of Chla concentrations across Lake Kasumigaura using the seven processors showed that all processors-except for the BOL and FUB-were able to accurately capture the Chla distribution for moderate and high Chla concentrations. In addition, MCI_L1 and C2R processors were evaluated over 10-years of monthly measured Chla as they demonstrated the best retrieval accuracy from both groups (i.e., band height and neural network, respectively). The retrieved Chla of MCI_L1 was more accurate at tracking seasonal and annual variation in Chla than C2R, with only slight overestimation occurring during the springtime."	https://doi.org/10.3390/rs9101022	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Salem, SI"	"Salem, SI[Salem, Salem Ibrahim]; Strand, MH[Strand, Marie Hayashi]; Higa, H[Higa, Hiroto]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Kazuhiro, K[Kazuhiro, Komatsu]; Oki, K[Oki, Kazuo]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	7	타기관	3.406	1.386	4.00	Y	Article

Due to former limitations in computational power and input datasets, most GRMs have been developed to use simplified representations of flow physics and run at coarse spatial resolutions. With increasing computational power and improved datasets, the application of GRMs to finer resolutions is becoming a reality. To support development in this direction, the suitability of GRMs for application to finer resolutions needs to be assessed. This study investigates the impacts of spatial resolution and flow connectivity representation on the predictive capability of a GRM, CaMa-Flood, in simulating the 2011 extreme flood in Thailand. Analyses show that when single downstream connectivity (SDC) is assumed, simulation results deteriorate with finer spatial resolution; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients decreased by more than 50% between simulation results at 10 km resolution and 1 km resolution. When multiple downstream connectivity (MDC) is represented, simulation results slightly improve with finer spatial resolution. The SDC simulations result in excessive backflows on very flat floodplains due to the restrictive flow directions at finer resolutions. MDC channels attenuated these effects by maintaining flow connectivity and flow capacity between floodplains in varying spatial resolutions. While a regional-scale flood was chosen as a test case, these findings should be universal and may have significant impacts on large-to globalscale simulations, especially in regions where mega deltas exist. These results demonstrate that a GRM can be used for higher resolution simulations of large-scale floods, provided that MDC in rivers and floodplains is adequately represented in the model structure."	https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5143-2017	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Mateo, CMR"	"Mateo, CMR[Mateo, Cherry May R.]; Yamazaki, D[Yamazaki, Dai]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Champathong, A[Champathong, Adisorn]; Vaze, J[Vaze, Jai]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	6	타기관	4.256	2.023	5.00	Y	Article

The ultimate goal of this study is to reconstruct historical weather by deriving total cloud cover (TCC) from historically documented weather records and to assimilate them using a general circulation model and a data assimilation scheme. Two experiments are performed using the Global Spectral Model and an ensemble Kalman filter: 1) a reanalysis data experiment and 2) a ground observation data experiment, for 18 synthesized observation stations in Japan according to the Historical Weather Data Base. By assuming that weather records can be converted into three TCC categories, the synthetic observation data of daily TCC are created from reanalysis data, with a large observation error of 30%, and by classifying ground observation data into the three categories. Compared with the simulation without assimilation of any observation, the results of the reanalysis data experiment show improvements, not only in TCC but also in other meteorological variables (e.g., humidity, precipitation, precipitable water, wind, and pressure). For specific humidity at 2 m above the surface, the monthly averaged root-mean-square error is reduced by 18%-22% downstream of the assimilated region. The results of the ground observation data experiment are not as successful as a result of additional error sources, indicating the bias needs to be handled correctly. By showing improvements with the loosely classified cloud information, the feasibility of the developed model to be applied for historical weather reconstruction is confirmed."	https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0288.1	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Toride, K"	"Toride, K[Toride, Kinya]; Neluwala, P[Neluwala, Panduka]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Yoshimura, K[Yoshimura, Kei]"	4	타기관	3.247	2.636	4.00	Y	Article

The 3.5 +/- 0.1 ppm rise in global annual mean carbon dioxide from 2015 to 2016 was the largest annual increase observed in the 58-year measurement record. The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth's surface surpassed 400 ppm (402.9 +/- 0.1 ppm) for the first time in the modern atmospheric measurement record and in ice core records dating back as far as 800000 years. One of the strongest El Nino events since at least 1950 dissipated in spring, and a weak La Nina evolved later in the year. Owing at least in part to the combination of El Nino conditions early in the year and a long-term upward trend, Earth's surface observed record warmth for a third consecutive year, albeit by a much slimmer margin than by which that record was set in 2015. Above Earth's surface, the annual lower troposphere temperature was record high according to all datasets analyzed, while the lower stratospheric temperature was record low according to most of the in situ and satellite datasets. Several countries, including Mexico and India, reported record high annual temperatures while many others observed near-record highs. A week-long heat wave at the end of April over the northern and eastern Indian peninsula, with temperatures surpassing 44 degrees C, contributed to a water crisis for 330 million people and to 300 fatalities. In the Arctic the 2016 land surface temperature was 2.0 degrees C above the 1981-2010 average, breaking the previous record of 2007, 2011, and 2015 by 0.8 degrees C, representing a 3.5 degrees C increase since the record began in 1900. The increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. On 24 March, the sea ice extent at the end of the growth season saw its lowest maximum in the 37-year satellite record, tying with 2015 at 7.2% below the 1981-2010 average. The September 2016 Arctic sea ice minimum extent tied with 2007 for the second lowest value on record, 33% lower than the 1981-2010 average. Arctic sea ice cover remains relatively young and thin, making it vulnerable to continued extensive melt. The mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which has the capacity to contribute similar to 7 m to sea level rise, reached a record low value. The onset of its surface melt was the second earliest, after 2012, in the 37-year satellite record. Sea surface temperature was record high at the global scale, surpassing the previous record of 2015 by about 0.01 degrees C. The global sea surface temperature trend for the 21st century-to-date of +0.162 degrees C decade(-1) is much higher than the longer term 1950-2016 trend of +0.100 degrees C decade(-1). Global annual mean sea level also reached a new record high, marking the sixth consecutive year of increase. Global annual ocean heat content saw a slight drop compared to the record high in 2015. Alpine glacier retreat continued around the globe, and preliminary data indicate that 2016 is the 37th consecutive year of negative annual mass balance. Across the Northern Hemisphere, snow cover for each month from February to June was among its four least extensive in the 47-year satellite record. Continuing a pattern below the surface, record high temperatures at 20-m depth were measured at all permafrost observatories on the North Slope of Alaska and at the Canadian observatory on northernmost Ellesmere Island. In the Antarctic, record low monthly surface pressures were broken at many stations, with the southern annular mode setting record high index values in March and June. Monthly high surface pressure records for August and November were set at several stations. During this period, record low daily and monthly sea ice extents were observed, with the November mean sea ice extent more than 5 standard deviations below the 1981-2010 average. These record low sea ice values contrast sharply with the record high values observed during 2012-14. Over the region, springtime Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion was less severe relative to the 1991-2006 average, but ozone levels were still low compared to pre-1990 levels. Closer to the equator, 93 named tropical storms were observed during 2016, above the 1981-2010 average of 82, but fewer than the 101 storms recorded in 2015. Three basins-the North Atlantic, and eastern and western North Pacific-experienced above-normal activity in 2016. The Australian basin recorded its least active season since the beginning of the satellite era in 1970. Overall, four tropical cyclones reached the Saffir-Simpson category 5 intensity level. The strong El Nino at the beginning of the year that transitioned to a weak La Nina contributed to enhanced precipitation variability around the world. Wet conditions were observed throughout the year across southern South America, causing repeated heavy flooding in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Wetter-than-usual conditions were also observed for eastern Europe and central Asia, alleviating the drought conditions of 2014 and 2015 in southern Russia. In the United States, California had its first wetter-than-average year since 2012, after being plagued by drought for several years. Even so, the area covered by drought in 2016 at the global scale was among the largest in the post-1950 record. For each month, at least 12% of land surfaces experienced severe drought conditions or worse, the longest such stretch in the record. In northeastern Brazil, drought conditions were observed for the fifth consecutive year, making this the longest drought on record in the region. Dry conditions were also observed in western Bolivia and Peru; it was Bolivia's worst drought in the past 25 years. In May, with abnormally warm and dry conditions already prevailing over western Canada for about a year, the human-induced Fort McMurray wildfire burned nearly 590000 hectares and became the costliest disaster in Canadian history, with $3 billion (U.S. dollars) in insured losses."	https://doi.org/10.1175/2017BAMSStateoftheClimate.1	2021-07-13	2023-01-06	"Arndt, DS"	"Arndt, DS[Arndt, D.

In this research, seven algorithms are assessed with different band combinations of multispectral and hyperspectral bands using linear (LN), quadratic polynomial (QP) and power (PW) regression approaches, resulting in altogether 43 algorithmic combinations. These algorithms are evaluated by using simulated and measured datasets to understand the strengths and limitations of these algorithms. Two simulated datasets comprising 500,000 reflectance spectra each, both based on wide ranges of inherent optical properties (IOPs), are generated for the calibration and validation stages. Results reveal that the regression approach (i.e., LN, QP, and PW) has more influence on the simulated dataset than on the measured one. The algorithms that incorporated linear regression provide the highest retrieval accuracy for the simulated dataset. Results from simulated datasets reveal that the 3-band (3b) algorithm that incorporate 665-nm and 680-nm bands and band tuning selection approach outperformed other algorithms with root mean square error (RMSE) of 15.87 mg.m(-3), 16.25 mg.m(-3), and 19.05 mg.m(-3), respectively. The spatial distribution of the best performing algorithms, for various combinations of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and non-algal particles (NAP) concentrations, show that the 3b_tuning_QP and 3b_680_QP outperform other algorithms in terms of minimum RMSE frequency of 33.19% and 60.52%, respectively. However, the two algorithms failed to accurately retrieve Chla for many combinations of Chla and NAP, particularly for low Chla and NAP concentrations. In addition, the spatial distribution emphasizes that no single algorithm can provide outstanding accuracy for Chla retrieval and that multi-algorithms should be included to reduce the error. Comparing the results of the measured and simulated datasets reveal that the algorithms that incorporate the 665-nm band outperform other algorithms for measured dataset (RMSE = 36.84 mg.m(-3)), while algorithms that incorporate the band tuning approach provide the highest retrieval accuracy for the simulated dataset (RMSE = 25.05 mg.m(-3))."	https://doi.org/10.3390/s17081746	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Salem, SI"	"Salem, SI[Salem, Salem Ibrahim]; Higa, H[Higa, Hiroto]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Kobayashi, H[Kobayashi, Hiroshi]; Oki, K[Oki, Kazuo]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	6	타기관	2.475	0.584	3.67	Y	Article

Using a mesoscale river routing scheme (RRS), this study evaluates simulated streamflows over the upper Oueme River basin resulting from 14 LSMs within the framework of phase 2 of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) Land Surface Model Intercomparison Project (ALMIP2). The ALMIP2 RRS (ARTS) has been used to route LSM outputs. ARTS is based on the nonlinear Muskingum-Cunge method and a simple deep water infiltration formulation representing water-table recharge as previously observed in that region. Simulations are performed for the 2005-08 period during which ground observations are largely available. Experiments are designed using different ground-based rainfall datasets derived from two interpolation methods: the Thiessen technique and a combined kriging-Lagrangian methodology. LSM-based total runoff (TR) averages vary from 0.07 to 1.97mmday(-1), while optimal TR was estimated as; 0.65mmday(-1). This highly affected the RRS parameterization and streamflow simulations. Optimal Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients for LSM-averaged streamflows varied from 0.66 to 0.92, depending on the gauge station. However, individual LSM performances show a wider range. A more detailed rainfall distribution provided by the kriging-Lagrangian methodology resulted in overall better streamflow simulations. The early runoff generation related to reduced infiltration rates during early rainfall events features as one of the main reasons for poor LSM performances."	https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-16-0233.1	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Getirana, A"	"Getirana, A [Getirana, Augusto]; Boone, A [Boone, Aaron]; Peugeot, C [Peugeot, Christophe]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	4	타기관	3.79	2.243	5.00	Y	Article

Here we evaluate to what degree the choice of river routing scheme affects simulations of peak discharge and may help to provide better agreement with observations. To this end we use runoff and discharge simulations of nine GHMs forced by observational climate data (1971-2010) within the ISIMIP2a project. The runoff simulations were used as input for the global river routing model CaMa-Flood. The simulated daily discharge was compared to the discharge generated by each GHM using its native river routing scheme. For each GHM both versions of simulated discharge were compared to monthly and daily discharge observations from 1701 GRDC stations as a benchmark. CaMaFlood routing shows a general reduction of peak river discharge and a delay of about two to three weeks in its occurrence, likely induced by the buffering capacity of floodplain reservoirs. For a majority of river basins, discharge produced by CaMa-Flood resulted in a better agreement with observations. In particular, maximum daily discharge was adjusted, with a multi-model averaged reduction in bias over about 2/3 of the analysed basin area. The increase in agreement was obtained in both managed and near-natural basins. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of routing scheme choice in peak discharge simulation, where CaMa-Flood routing accounts for floodplain storage and backwater effects that are not represented in most GHMs. Our study provides important hints that an explicit parameterisation of these processes may be essential in future impact studies."	https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7250	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Zhao, F"	"Zhao, F[Zhao, Fang]; Veldkamp, TIE[Veldkamp, Ted I.

In addition, the evolution of hydrological systems in this region, and particularly the increase of surface water and runoff coefficients observed since the 1950s, has had a strong impact on water resources and on the occurrence of floods events. This study addresses results from phase 2 of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) Land Surface Model Intercomparison Project (ALMIP2), carried out to evaluate the capability of different state-of-the-art land surface models to reproduce surface processes at the mesoscale. Evaluation of runoff and water fluxes over the Mali site is carried out through comparison with runoff estimations over endorheic watersheds as well as evapotranspiration (ET) measurements. Three remote-sensing-based ET products [ALEXI, MODIS, and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM)] are also analyzed. It is found that, over deep sandy soils, surface runoff is generally overestimated, but the ALMIP2 multimodel mean reproduces in situ measurements of ET and water stress events rather well. However, ALMIP2 models are generally unable to distinguish among the two contrasted hydrological systems typical of the study area. Employing as input a soil map that explicitly represents shallow soils improves the representation of water fluxes for the models that can account for their representation. Shallow soils are shown to be also quite challenging for remote-sensing-based ET products, even if their effect on evaporative loss was captured by the diagnostic thermal-based ALEXI. A better representation of these soils, in soil databases, model parameterizations, and remote sensing algorithms, is fundamental to improve the estimation of water fluxes in this part of the Sahel."	https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-16-0170.1	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Grippa, M"	"Grippa, M [Grippa, Manuela]; Kergoat, L [Kergoat, Laurent]; Boone, A [Boone, Aaron]; Peugeot, C [Peugeot, Christophe]; Demarty, J [Demarty, Jerome]; Cappelaere, B [Cappelaere, Bernard]; Gal, L [Gal, Laetitia]; Hiernaux, P [Hiernaux, Pierre]; Mougin, E [Mougin, Eric]; Ducharne, A [Ducharne, Agnes]; Dutra, E [Dutra, Emanuel]; Anderson, M [Anderson, Martha]; Hain, C [Hain, Christopher]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	14	타기관	3.79	2.243	5.00	Y	Article

Semi-analytical algorithms and spectrum matching are two major approaches for chlorophyll-a (Chla) retrieval. Semi-analytical algorithms provide indices correlated with phytoplankton characteristics, (e.g., maximum and minimum absorption peaks). Algorithms' indices are correlated with measured Chla through the regression process. The main drawback of the semi-analytical algorithms is that the derived relation is location and data limited. Spectrum matching and the look-up table approach rely on matching the measured reflectance with a large library of simulated references corresponding to wide ranges of water properties. The spectral matching approach taking hyperspectral measured reflectance as an input, leading to difficulties in incorporating data from multispectral satellites. Consequently, multi-algorithm indices and the look-up table (MAIN-LUT) technique is proposed to combine the merits of semi-analytical algorithms and look-up table, which can be applied to multispectral data. Eight combinations of four algorithms (i.e., 2-band, 3-band, maximum chlorophyll index, and normalized difference chlorophyll index) are investigated for the MAIN-LUT technique. In situ measurements and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor data are used to validate MAIN-LUT. In general, the MAIN-LUT provide a comparable retrieval accuracy with locally tuned algorithms. The most accurate of the locally tuned algorithms varied among datasets, revealing the limitation of these algorithms to be applied universally. In contrast, the MAIN-LUT provided relatively high retrieval accuracy for Tokyo Bay (R-2 = 0.692, root mean square error (RMSE) = 21.4 mg m(-3)), Lake Kasumigaura (R-2 = 0.866, RMSE = 11.3 mg m(-3)), and MERIS data over Lake Kasumigaura (R-2 = 0.57, RMSE = 36.5 mg m(-3)). The simulated reflectance library of MAIN-LUT was generated based on inherent optical properties of Tokyo Bay; however, the MAIN-LUT also provided high retrieval accuracy for Lake Kasumigaura.

Despite its importance, the seasonal variability of ET over Amazon forests, and its relationship with environmental drivers, is still poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a water balance approach to analyse seasonal patterns in ET and their relationships with water and energy drivers over five sub-basins across the Amazon Basin. We used in situ measurements of river discharge, and remotely sensed estimates of terrestrial water storage, rainfall, and solar radiation. We show that the characteristics of ET seasonality in all sub-basins differ in timing and magnitude. The highest mean annual ET was found in the northern Rio Negro basin (similar to 1497 mm year(-1)) and the lowest values in the Solimoes River basin (similar to 986 mm year(-1)). For the first time in a basin-scale study, using observational data, we show that factors limiting ET vary across climatic gradients in the Amazon, confirming local-scale eddy covariance studies. Both annual mean and seasonality in ET are driven by a combination of energy and water availability, as neither rainfall nor radiation alone could explain patterns in ET. In southern basins, despite seasonal rainfall deficits, deep root water uptake allows increasing rates of ET during the dry season, when radiation is usually higher than in the wet season. We demonstrate contrasting ET seasonality with satellite greenness across Amazon forests, with strong asynchronous relationships in ever-wet watersheds, and positive correlations observed in seasonally dry watersheds. Finally, we compared our results with estimates obtained by two ET models, and we conclude that neither of the two tested models could provide a consistent representation of ET seasonal patterns across the Amazon."	https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-439-2017	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Maeda, EE"	"Maeda, EE[Maeda, Eduardo Eiji]; Ma, XL[Ma, Xuanlong]; Wagner, FH[Wagner, Fabien Hubert]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]; Eamus, D[Eamus, Derek]; Huete, A[Huete, Alfredo]"	7	타기관	3.769	2.253	5.00	Y	Article

Here we show that HI drastically change the critical dimensions of water scarcity, aggravating water scarcity for 8.8% (7.4-16.5%) of the global population but alleviating it for another 8.3% (6.4-15.8%). Positive impacts of HI mostly occur upstream, whereas HI aggravate water scarcity downstream; HI cause water scarcity to travel downstream. Attribution of water scarcity changes to HI components is complex and varies among the hydrological models. Seasonal variation in impacts and dominant HI components is also substantial. A thorough consideration of the spatially and temporally varying interactions among HI components and of uncertainties is therefore crucial for the success of water scarcity adaptation by HI."	https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15697	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Veldkamp, TIE"	"Veldkamp, TIE[Veldkamp, T.

An objective method of classification of the precipitating weather systems was used with a reanalysis data set and a satellite-based precipitation product for 2001-2010. Tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones with associated fronts, and other weather systems contribute about 4%, 37%, and 59%, respectively, of the global (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) mean precipitation. The relative contributions of the weather systems were found to be different both in terms of the different classes of precipitation intensity and in terms of the different temporal scales of precipitation. Tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones produced greater contributions to extreme hourly precipitation than to annual precipitation in most of the oceanic regions of their activity. The contributions of tropical cyclones to extreme precipitation showed clear peaks on temporal scales of 24-72h. The contributions of extratropical cyclones showed less dependence on the temporal scale than tropical cyclones. Consideration of combinations of multiple weather systems revealed that in eastern North America and East Asia, substantial portions (22% and 19%, respectively) of the extreme 24h precipitation related to tropical cyclones are contributed by the coexistence of tropical cyclones and fronts. However, such contributions were found rarely in other land regions. On most temporal scales, fronts at locations remote from the centers of extratropical cyclones were found to contribute to extreme precipitation as much as the centers of extratropical cyclones."	https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JD025222	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Utsumi, N"	"Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Kanae, S[Kanae, Shinjiro]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	4	타기관	3.38		4.00	Y	Article

However, questions such as Which weather systems will cause which changes? and Is the relative importance of these weather systems likely to change in the future? have not been addressed fully yet. Here we present the first global estimates of the relative contributions of different weather systems (i.e., tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones including fronts, and others) to changes in annual mean and extreme precipitation in the late 21st century using multimodel projections of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. Although the models present biases in tropical cyclones over southern hemisphere, in particular, the representations of global weather system patterns are comparable to the reanalysis data. Total precipitation from tropical cyclones decreases (increases) in the tropics (subtropics) and that from extratropical cyclones including fronts decreases (increases) on the equatorial (poleward) side of the storm tracks. In addition, the mean intensity and frequency of system-wise precipitation can change significantly even without considerable changes in annual amounts. We found that the subtropics, particularly in the Pacific and North Atlantic, are the regions where the proportions of precipitation by weather systems in annual mean and extreme precipitation display notable changes, suggesting distinct shifts in climate regimes. These regions have a common feature: they undergo the influence of several distinct weather systems in the present climate. In regions where climate regime shifts are projected, even the weather systems that have a minor contribution to precipitation in the present climate may cause considerable changes in annual and extreme precipitation."	https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JD024939	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Utsumi, N"	"Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Kanae, S[Kanae, Shinjiro]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	4	타기관	3.454		4.00	Y	Article

The solid and liquid water stored at the land surface has a large influence on the regional climate, its variability and predictability, including effects on the energy, water and carbon cycles. Notably, snow and soil moisture affect surface radiation and flux partitioning properties, moisture storage and land surface memory. They both strongly affect atmospheric conditions, in particular surface air temperature and precipitation, but also large-scale circulation patterns. However, models show divergent responses and representations of these feedbacks as well as systematic biases in the underlying processes. LS3MIP will provide the means to quantify the associated uncertainties and better constrain climate change projections, which is of particular interest for highly vulnerable regions (densely populated areas, agricultural regions, the Arctic, semi-arid and other sensitive terrestrial ecosystems). The experiments are subdivided in two components, the first addressing systematic land biases in offline mode (""LMIP"", building upon the 3rd phase of Global Soil Wetness Project; GSWP3) and the second addressing land feedbacks attributed to soil moisture and snow in an integrated framework (""LFMIP"", building upon the GLACE-CMIP blueprint)."	https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-2809-2016	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"van den Hurk, B"	"van den Hurk, B[van den Hurk, Bart]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Krinner, G[Krinner, Gerhard]; Seneviratne, SI[Seneviratne, Sonia I.]; Derksen, C[Derksen, Chris]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]; Douville, H[Douville, Herve]; Colin, J[Colin, Jeanne]; Ducharne, A[Ducharne, Agnes]; Cheruy, F[Cheruy, Frederique]; Viovy, N[Viovy, Nicholas]; Puma, MJ[Puma, Michael J.]; Wada, Y[Wada, Yoshihide]; Li, WP[Li, Weiping]; Jia, BH[Jia, Binghao]; Alessandri, A[Alessandri, Andrea]; Lawrence, DM[Lawrence, Dave M.]; Weedon, GP[Weedon, Graham P.]; Ellis, R[Ellis, Richard]; Hagemann, S[Hagemann, Stefan]; Mao, JF[Mao, Jiafu]; Flanner, MG[Flanner, Mark G.]; Zampieri, M[Zampieri, Matteo]; Materia, S[Materia, Stefano]; Law, RM[Law, Rachel M.]; Sheffield, J[Sheffield, Justin]"	26	타기관	3.458	2.07	5.00	Y	Article

As the changes in the water cycle on land can affect the functioning of a wide range of biophysical and biogeochemical processes of the Earth system, it is essential to represent human land-water management in Earth system models (ESMs). During the recent past, noteworthy progress has been made in large-scale modeling of human impacts on the water cycle but sufficient advancements have not yet been made in integrating the newly developed schemes into ESMs. This study reviews the progresses made in incorporating human factors in large-scale hydrological models and their integration into ESMs. The study focuses primarily on the recent advancements and existing challenges in incorporating human impacts in global land surface models (LSMs) as a way forward to the development of ESMs with humans as integral components, but a brief review of global hydrological models (GHMs) is also provided. The study begins with the general overview of human impacts on the water cycle. Then, the algorithms currently employed to represent irrigation, reservoir operation, and groundwater pumping are discussed. Next, methodological deficiencies in current modeling approaches and existing challenges are identified. Furthermore, light is shed on the sources of uncertainties associated with model parameterizations, grid resolution, and datasets used for forcing and validation. Finally, representing human land-water management in LSMs is highlighted as an important research direction toward developing integrated models using ESM frameworks for the holistic study of human-water interactions within the Earths system.

The values of simulated water balance components may vary due to different spatial and temporal aggregations, reference periods, and applied climate forcings, as well as due to the consideration of human water use, or the lack thereof. We analyzed these variations over the period 1901-2010 by forcing the global hydrological model WaterGAP 2.2 (ISIMIP2a) with five state-of-the-art climate data sets, including a homogenized version of the concatenated WFD/WFDEI data set. Absolute values and temporal variations of global water balance components are strongly affected by the uncertainty in the climate forcing, and no temporal trends of the global water balance components are detected for the four homogeneous climate forcings considered (except for human water abstractions). The calibration of WaterGAP against observed long-term average river discharge Q significantly reduces the impact of climate forcing uncertainty on estimated Q and renewable water resources. For the homogeneous forcings, Q of the calibrated and non-calibrated regions of the globe varies by 1.6 and 18.5 %, respectively, for 1971-2000. On the continental scale, most differences for long-term average precipitation P and Q estimates occur in Africa and, due to snow undercatch of rain gauges, also in the data-rich continents Europe and North America. Variations of Q at the grid-cell scale are large, except in a few grid cells upstream and downstream of calibration stations, with an average variation of 37 and 74% among the four homogeneous forcings in calibrated and non-calibrated regions, respectively. Considering only the forcings GSWP3 and WFDEI_hom, i.e., excluding the forcing without undercatch correction (PGFv2.1) and the one with a much lower shortwave downward radiation SWD than the others (WFD), Q variations are reduced to 16 and 31% in calibrated and non-calibrated regions, respectively. These simulation results support the need for extended Q measurements and data sharing for better constraining global water balance assessments. Over the 20th century, the human footprint on natural water resources has become larger. For 11-18% of the global land area, the change of Q between 19411970 and 1971-2000 was driven more strongly by change of human water use including dam construction than by change in precipitation, while this was true for only 9-13% of the land area from 1911-1940 to 1941-1970."	https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2877-2016	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Muller Schmied, H"	"Muller Schmied, H[Mueller Schmied, Hannes]; Adam, L[Adam, Linda]; Eisner, S[Eisner, Stephanie]; Fink, G[Fink, Gabriel]; Florke, M[Floerke, Martina]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]; Portmann, FT[Portmann, Felix Theodor]; Reinecke, R[Reinecke, Robert]; Riedel, C[Riedel, Claudia]; Song, Q[Song, Qi]; Zhang, J[Zhang, Jing]; Doll, P[Doell, Petra]"	13	타기관	4.437	2.216	5.00	Y	Article

In this study, we show evidence of a fragile hydrological equilibrium in the western Amazon. While drainage systems located near the equator and the western Amazon do not show water deficit in years with average climate conditions, this equilibrium can be broken during drought events. More importantly, we show that this effect is persistent, taking years until the normal hydrological patterns are reestablished. We show clear links between persistent changes in forest canopy structure and changes in hydrological patterns, revealing physical evidence of hydrological mechanisms that may lead to permanent changes in parts of the Amazon ecosystem. If prospects of increasing drought frequency are confirmed, a change in the current hydroecological patterns in the western Amazon could take place in less than a decade."	https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GL065252	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Maeda, EE"	"Maeda, EE[Maeda, Eduardo Eiji]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Aragao, LEOC[Aragao, Luiz E.

Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide-the major greenhouse gases released into Earth's atmosphere-once again all reached record high average atmospheric concentrations for the year. Carbon dioxide increased by 1.9 ppm to reach a globally averaged value of 397.2 ppm for 2014. Altogether, 5 major and 15 minor greenhouse gases contributed 2.94 W m(-2) of direct radiative forcing, which is 36% greater than their contributions just a quarter century ago. Accompanying the record-high greenhouse gas concentrations was nominally the highest annual global surface temperature in at least 135 years of modern record keeping, according to four independent observational analyses. The warmth was distributed widely around the globe's land areas, Europe observed its warmest year on record by a large margin, with close to two dozen countries breaking their previous national temperature records; many countries in Asia had annual temperatures among their 10 warmest on record; Africa reported above-average temperatures across most of the continent throughout 2014; Australia saw its third warmest year on record, following record heat there in 2013; Mexico had its warmest year on record; and Argentina and Uruguay each had their second warmest year on record. Eastern North America was the only major region to observe a below-average annual temperature. But it was the oceans that drove the record global surface temperature in 2014. Although 2014 was largely ENSO-neutral, the globally averaged sea surface temperature (SST) was the highest on record. The warmth was particularly notable in the North Pacific Ocean where SST anomalies signaled a transition from a negative to positive phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation. In the winter of 2013/14, unusually warm water in the northeast Pacific was associated with elevated ocean heat content anomalies and elevated sea level in the region. Globally, upper ocean heat content was record high for the year, reflecting the continued increase of thermal energy in the oceans, which absorb over 90% of Earth's excess heat from greenhouse gas forcing. Owing to both ocean warming and land ice melt contributions, global mean sea level in 2014 was also record high and 67 mm greater than the 1993 annual mean, when satellite altimetry measurements began. Sea surface salinity trends over the past decade indicate that salty regions grew saltier while fresh regions became fresher, suggestive of an increased hydrological cycle over the ocean expected with global warming. As in previous years, these patterns are reflected in 2014 subsurface salinity anomalies as well. With a now decade-long trans-basin instrument array along 26 degrees N, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation shows a decrease in transport of -4.2 +/- 2.5 Sv decade(-1). Precipitation was quite variable across the globe. On balance, precipitation over the world's oceans was above average, while below average across land surfaces. Drought continued in southeastern Brazil and the western United States. Heavy rain during April-June led to devastating floods in Canada's Eastern Prairies. Above-normal summer monsoon rainfall was observed over the southern coast of West Africa, while drier conditions prevailed over the eastern Sahel. Generally, summer monsoon rainfall over eastern Africa was above normal, except in parts of western South Sudan and Ethiopia. The south Asian summer monsoon in India was below normal, with June record dry. Across the major tropical cyclone basins, 91 named storms were observed during 2014, above the 1981-2010 global average of 82. The Eastern/Central Pacific and South Indian Ocean basins experienced significantly above-normal activity in 2014; all other basins were either at or below normal. The 22 named storms in the Eastern/Central Pacific was the basin's most since 1992. Similar to 2013, the North Atlantic season was quieter than most years of the last two decades with respect to the number of storms, despite the absence of El Nino conditions during both years. In higher latitudes and at higher elevations, increased warming continued to be visible in the decline of glacier mass balance, increasing permafrost temperatures, and a deeper thawing layer in seasonally frozen soil. In the Arctic, the 2014 temperature over land areas was the fourth highest in the 115-year period of record and snow melt occurred 20-30 days earlier than the 1998-2010 average. The Greenland Ice Sheet experienced extensive melting in summer 2014. The extent of melting was above the 1981-2010 average for 90% of the melt season, contributing to the second lowest average summer albedo over Greenland since observations began in 2000 and a record-low albedo across the ice sheet for August. On the North Slope of Alaska, new record high temperatures at 20-m depth were measured at four of five permafrost observatories. In September, Arctic minimum sea ice extent was the sixth lowest since satellite records began in 1979. The eight lowest sea ice extents during this period have occurred in the last eight years. Conversely, in the Antarctic, sea ice extent countered its declining trend and set several new records in 2014, including record high monthly mean sea ice extent each month from April to November. On 20 September, a record large daily Antarctic sea ice extent of 20.14 x 106 km(2) occurred. The 2014 Antarctic stratospheric ozone hole was 20.9 million km2 when averaged from 7 September to 13 October, the sixth smallest on record and continuing a decrease, albeit statistically insignificant, in area since 1998."	https://doi.org/10.1175/2015BAMSStateoftheClimate.1	2021-07-13	2023-01-06	"Arndt, DS"	"Arndt, DS[Arndt, D.

In this study, the DCP over West Africa was simulated by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Regional Spectral Model (RSM) during the monsoon season (April-September) of 2005. Three convective parameterization schemes (CPSs), single-layer simplified Arakawa-Schubert (SAS), multilayer relaxed Arakawa-Schubert (RAS), and new Kain-Fritsch (KF2), were evaluated at two horizontal resolutions (20 and 10 km). The Benin mesoscale site was singled out for additional investigation of resolution effects. Harmonic analysis was used to characterize the phase and amplitude of the DCP. Compared to satellite observations, the overall spatial distributions of amplitude were well captured at regional scales. The RSM properly reproduced the observed late afternoon peak over land and the early morning peak over ocean. Nevertheless, the peak time was early. Sensitivity experiments of CPSs showed similar spatial patterns of rainfall totals among the schemes; CPSs mainly affected the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, while the phase was not significantly shifted. There is no clear optimal pairing of resolution and CPS. However, it is found that the sensitivity of DCP to CPSs and resolution varies with the partitioning between convective and stratiform, which implies that appropriate partitioning needs to be considered for future development of CPSs in global or regional climate models."	https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-14-00013.1	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"He, XG"	"He, XG[He, Xiaogang]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Kirstetter, PE[Kirstetter, Pierre-Emmanuel]; Yoshimura, K[Yoshimura, Kei]; Chang, EC[Chang, Eun-Chul]; Ferguson, CR[Ferguson, Craig R.]; Erlingis, JM[Erlingis, Jessica M.]; Hong, Y[Hong, Yang]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	9	타기관	1.972	1.77	3.00	Y	Article

CGLB also provides photographs containing vegetation information as well as quasi-real time monitoring of lake water levels. CGLB can interactively create and animate time series of climatological data in a one-dimensional or two-dimensional (geographical) form. These functions are useful for education, expedition planning, and scientific research. As an example of the application's use, links between water levels in Kenya's Lake Turkana and sea surface temperature (SST) and regional precipitation were tested by time-lag correlation analysis. Precipitation showed no significant correlation with the lake water level for time lags of 0, 1, and 2 months. This suggests that variation in land-surface hydrological processes are key to the inter-annual variability in water levels in the lake. In contrast, SST in the central tropical Pacific was strongly correlated with the lake water level for all time lags. No significant correlation was found between the lake water level and SST in the Indian Ocean adjacent to Kenya, although significant correlations were found between regional precipitation and SST in the Indian Ocean."	https://doi.org/10.3178/hrl.9.125	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Nakaegawa, T"	"Nakaegawa, T[Nakaegawa, Tosiyuki]; Horiuchi, S[Horiuchi, Shinichiro]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]"	3	타기관				Y	Article

Here we propose a research strategy for determining the spatiotemporal distribution of fronts using weather chart images published by the Japan Meteorological Agency, one of the major data providers in the region. A preliminarily investigation of the internal data characteristics for the period of 2000-2010 is undertaken, and the final 4 years of data are used for an analysis of front climatology to avoid the effect of any spurious trends. This enables in-depth analyses to be conducted, which have not previously been possible in the region, including the composites of cross-sectional patterns for the thermal fields and precipitation near fronts, front length seasonality, and the significance of the thermal gradient near the fronts, in addition to determining the frontal frequency and spatial distribution of frontal precipitation. Pixel-wise analysis reveals that 56% of the local precipitation maximum is located on the warm side of a cold front caused by less tilted upward motion on the warm side, with the intrusion of the upper level cold dry air into the warm side. This new data set also enables a further analysis of the occluded fronts, which are not correctly distinguished in the existing objective detection method."	https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JD021734	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Utsumi, N"	"Utsumi, N[Utsumi, Nobuyuki]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Seto, S[Seto, Shinta]; Kanae, S[Kanae, Shinjiro]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	5	타기관				Y	Article

ENSO was in a neutral state during the entire year, remaining mostly on the cool side of neutral with modest impacts on regional weather patterns' around the world. This follows several years dominated by the effects of either La Nina. or El Nino events. According to several independent analyses, 2013 was again among the 10 warmest years on record at the global scale, both at the Earth's surface and through the troposphere. Some regions in the Southern Hemispherehad record or near-record high temperatures for the year. Australia observed its hottest year on record, while Argentina and New Zealand reported their second and third hottest years, respectively. In Antarctica, Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station reported its highest annual temperature since records began in 1957 At the opposite pole, the Arctic observed its seventh warmest year since record's began in the early 20th century. At 20-m depth, record high temperatures were measured at some permafrost stations on the North Slope Of Alaska and in the Brooks Range. In the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, anomalous meridional atmospheric circulation occurred throughout much of the year leading to marked regional extremes of both temperature and precipitation. Cold temperature anomalies during Winter across Eurasia were followed by warm Spring temperature anomalies, which, were linked to a new record Eurasian snow cover extent in the May. Minimum sea ice extent in the :Arctic was the sixth lowest since satellite Observations began in 1979. Including 2013, all seven lowest extents on record have occurred in the past seven years Antarctica, on the other hand, had above average sea ice extent throughout 2013, with 116 days Of new daily high extent records, inclding a new daily maximum sea ice area of 19.57 million km(2) reached on 1 October. ENSO-neutral conditions in the eastern central Pacific Ocean and a negative Pacific decadal oscillation pattern in the North Pacific had the largest impacts on the global sea surface temperature in 2013: The North Pacific reached a historic high temperature in 2013 and on balance the globally-averaged sea surface temperature was among the 10 highest on record. Overall, the salt Content in near-surface ocean waters increased while in intermediate waters it decreased. Global mean sea level continued to rise during 2013, on pace with a trend of 3,2 mm yr(-1) over the past two decades. A portion of this trend (0.5 mm yr(-1)) has been attributed to natural variability associated with the Pacific decadal oscillation as Well as to ongoing contribution from the melting of glaciers and ice sheets and ocean warming. Global tropical cyclone frequency during 2013 was slightly above average with a total of 94 storms, although the North Atlantic Basin had its quietest hurricane season since 1994. In the Western North Pacific Basin, Super Typhoon Haiyan, the deadliest tropical Cyclone of 2013, had 1-minute sustained winds estimated to be 170 kt (OS m s(-1)) on 7 November, the highest Wind speed ever assigned to a tropical cyclone. High storm surge was also associated with Haiyan at it Made landfall over the central Philippines, an area where sea level is currently at historic highs increasing by 200 mm since 1970. In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide all Continued to increase in 2013. As in previous our years, each of these Major greenhouse gases once again reached historic high Concentrations. In the Arctic carbon dioxide and methane:, Increased at the same rate as:the global increase. These increases are likely due to export from lower latitudes rather than a consequence Of increases in Arctic sources such as thawing permafrost., At Mauna Loa, Hawaii, for the first time since measurement began in 1958, the daily average Mixing ratio Of carbon dioxide exceeded 400 ppm on 9 May."	https://doi.org/10.1175/2014BAMSStateoftheClimate.1	2021-07-13	2023-01-06	"Blunden, J"	"Blunden, J[Blunden, Jessica]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyuanjun]"	2	타기관	11.808	6.329	5.00	N	Article

In this paper we use river flow simulations from nine global hydrology and land surface models to explore uncertainties in the potential impacts of climate change on flood hazard at global scale. As an indicator of flood hazard we looked at changes in the 30-y return level of 5-d average peak flows under representative concentration pathway RCP8.5 at the end of this century. Not everywhere does climate change result in an increase in flood hazard: decreases in the magnitude and frequency of the 30-y return level of river flow occur at roughly one-third (20-45%) of the global land grid points, particularly in areas where the hydro-graph is dominated by the snowmelt flood peak in spring. In most model experiments, however, an increase in flooding frequency was found in more than half of the grid points. The current 30-y flood peak is projected to occur in more than 1 in 5 y across 5-30% of land grid points. The large-scale patterns of change are remarkably consistent among impact models and even the driving climate models, but at local scale and in individual river basins there can be disagreement even on the sign of change, indicating large modeling uncertainty which needs to be taken into account in local adaptation studies."	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1302078110	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Dankers, R"	"Dankers, R[Dankers, Rutger]; Arnell, NW[Arnell, Nigel W.]; Clark, DB[Clark, Douglas B.]; Falloon, PD[Falloon, Pete D.]; Fekete, BM[Fekete, Balazs M.]; Gosling, SN[Gosling, Simon N.]; Heinke, J[Heinke, Jens]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Masaki, Y[Masaki, Yoshimitsu]; Satoh, Y[Satoh, Yusuke]; Stacke, T[Stacke, Tobias]; Wada, Y[Wada, Yoshihide]; Wisser, D[Wisser, Dominik]"	13	타기관	9.674	6.853	5.00	Y	Article

We assess the impact of climate change on hydrological droughts in a multimodel experiment including seven global impact models (GIMs) driven by bias-corrected climate from five global climate models under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Drought severity is defined as the fraction of land under drought conditions. Results show a likely increase in the global severity of hydrological drought at the end of the 21st century, with systematically greater increases for RCPs describing stronger radiative forcings. Under RCP8.5, droughts exceeding 40% of analyzed land area are projected by nearly half of the simulations. This increase in drought severity has a strong signal-to-noise ratio at the global scale, and Southern Europe, the Middle East, the Southeast United States, Chile, and South West Australia are identified as possible hotspots for future water security issues. The uncertainty due to GIMs is greater than that from global climate models, particularly if including a GIM that accounts for the dynamic response of plants to CO2 and climate, as this model simulates little or no increase in drought frequency. Our study demonstrates that different representations of terrestrial water-cycle processes in GIMs are responsible for a much larger uncertainty in the response of hydrological drought to climate change than previously thought. When assessing the impact of climate change on hydrology, it is therefore critical to consider a diverse range of GIMs to better capture the uncertainty."	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1222473110	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Prudhomme, C"	"Prudhomme, C[Prudhomme, Christel]; Giuntoli, I[Giuntoli, Ignazio]; Robinson, EL[Robinson, Emma L.]; Clark, DB[Clark, Douglas B.]; Arnell, NW[Arnell, Nigel W.]; Dankers, R[Dankers, Rutger]; Fekete, BM[Fekete, Balazs M.]; Franssen, W[Franssen, Wietse]; Gerten, D[Gerten, Dieter]; Gosling, SN[Gosling, Simon N.]; Hagemann, S[Hagemann, Stefan]; Hannah, DM[Hannah, David M.]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Masaki, Y[Masaki, Yoshimitsu]; Satoh, Y[Satoh, Yusuke]; Stacke, T[Stacke, Tobias]; Wada, Y[Wada, Yoshihide]; Wisser, D[Wisser, Dominik]"	18	타기관	9.674	6.853	5.00	Y	Article

Expected future population changes will, in many countries as well as globally, increase the pressure on available water resources. On the supply side, renewable water resources will be affected by projected changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and other climate variables. Here we use a large ensemble of global hydrological models (GHMs) forced by five global climate models and the latest greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) to synthesize the current knowledge about climate change impacts on water resources. We show that climate change is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity considerably. In particular, the ensemble average projects that a global warming of 2 degrees C above present (approximately 2.7 degrees C above preindustrial) will confront an additional approximate 15% of the global population with a severe decrease in water resources and will increase the number of people living under absolute water scarcity (< 500 m(3) per capita per year) by another 40% (according to some models, more than 100%) compared with the effect of population growth alone. For some indicators of moderate impacts, the steepest increase is seen between the present day and 2 degrees C, whereas indicators of very severe impacts increase unabated beyond 2 degrees C. At the same time, the study highlights large uncertainties associated with these estimates, with both global climate models and GHMs contributing to the spread. GHM uncertainty is particularly dominant in many regions affected by declining water resources, suggesting a high potential for improved water resource projections through hydrological model development."	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1222460110	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Schewe, J"	"Schewe, J[Schewe, Jacob]; Heinke, J[Heinke, Jens]; Gerten, D[Gerten, Dieter]; Haddeland, I[Haddeland, Ingjerd]; Arnell, NW[Arnell, Nigel W.]; Clark, DB[Clark, Douglas B.]; Dankers, R[Dankers, Rutger]; Eisner, S[Eisner, Stephanie]; Fekete, BM[Fekete, Balazs M.]; Colon-Gonzalez, FJ[Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe J.]; Gosling, SN[Gosling, Simon N.]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Liu, XC[Liu, Xingcai]; Masaki, Y[Masaki, Yoshimitsu]; Portmann, FT[Portmann, Felix T.]; Satoh, Y[Satoh, Yusuke]; Stacke, T[Stacke, Tobias]; Tang, QH[Tang, Qiuhong]; Wada, Y[Wada, Yoshihide]; Wisser, D[Wisser, Dominik]; Albrecht, T[Albrecht, Torsten]; Frieler, K[Frieler, Katja]; Piontek, F[Piontek, Franziska]; Warszawski, L[Warszawski, Lila]; Kabat, P[Kabat, Pavel]"	25	타기관	9.674	6.853	5.00	Y	Article

To facilitate policy decisions on mitigation and adaptation strategies, it is necessary to understand, quantify, and synthesize these climate-change impacts, taking into account their uncertainties. Crucial to these decisions is an understanding of how impacts in different sectors overlap, as overlapping impacts increase exposure, lead to interactions of impacts, and are likely to raise adaptation pressure. As a first step we develop herein a framework to study coinciding impacts and identify regional exposure hotspots. This framework can then be used as a starting point for regional case studies on vulnerability and multifaceted adaptation strategies. We consider impacts related to water, agriculture, ecosystems, and malaria at different levels of global warming. Multisectoral overlap starts to be seen robustly at a mean global warming of 3 degrees C above the 1980-2010 mean, with 11% of the world population subject to severe impacts in at least two of the four impact sectors at 4 degrees C. Despite these general conclusions, we find that uncertainty arising from the impact models is considerable, and larger than that from the climate models. In a low probability-high impact worst-case assessment, almost the whole inhabited world is at risk for multisectoral pressures. Hence, there is a pressing need for an increased research effort to develop a more comprehensive understanding of impacts, as well as for the development of policy measures under existing uncertainty."	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1222471110	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Piontek, F"	"Piontek, F[Piontek, Franziska]; Muller, C[Mueller, Christoph]; Pugh, TAM[Pugh, Thomas A.

However, most continental-scale river models have not focused on the reproduction of water level because the storage and movement of surface waters are regulated by smaller-scale topography than their grid resolutions. Here we analyzed the water level dynamics simulated by a state-of-the-art global river model, CaMa-Flood, with subgrid representation of floodplain topography. As a case study, hydrodynamics simulation in the Amazon River was accomplished, and the simulated water surface elevations along the main stem were compared against Envisat altimetry. The seasonal cycles of the simulated water surface elevations are in agreement with the altimetry (correlation coefficient >0.69, annual amplitude error <1.6 m). The accuracy of absolute water surface elevations was also good (averaged RMSE of 1.83 m), and the associated errors were within the range of the model uncertainty due to channel cross-section parameters. Then the ocean tide variation at river mouth was incorporated for simulating the tidal effect in the inland Amazon basin, which requires realistic representation of absolute water surface elevations. By applying power spectra analysis to the simulated water level variations, the 15 day cycle due to spring and neap tides was detected at Obidos, located 800 km upstream from the river mouth. The reproduction of the ocean tide propagation to the inland region suggests that CaMa-Flood includes the main physical processes needed to accurately simulate the water level dynamics in continental-scale rivers."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2012WR011869	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Yamazaki, D"	"Yamazaki, D[Yamazaki, Dai]; Lee, H[Lee, Hyongki]; Alsdorf, DE[Alsdorf, Douglas E.]; Dutra, E[Dutra, Emanuel]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Kanae, S[Kanae, Shinjiro]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	7	타기관	3.149	2.123	5.00	Y	Article

Despite numerous advances in the development of land surface models (LSMs) and global terrestrial hydrological models (GHMs), relatively few studies have attempted to simulate the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the terrestrial water cycle using the framework of LSMs. From the comparison of simulated terrestrial water storage with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations it is found that a process-based LSM, the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO), outperforms the bucket-model-based OHM called H08 in simulating hydrologic variables, particularly in water-limited regions. Therefore, the water regulation modules of H08 are incorporated into MATSIRO. Further, a new irrigation scheme based on the soil moisture deficit is developed. Incorporation of anthropogenic water regulation modules significantly improves river discharge simulation in the heavily regulated global river basins. Simulated irrigation water withdrawal for the year 2000 (2462 km(3) yr(-1)) agrees well with the estimates provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Results indicate that irrigation changes surface energy balance, causing a maximum increase of similar to 50 W m(-2) in latent heat flux averaged over June-August. Moreover, unsustainable anthropogenic water use in 2000 is estimated to be similar to 450 km(3) yr(-1), which corresponds well with documented records of groundwater overdraft, representing an encouraging improvement over the previous modeling studies. Globally, unsustainable water use accounts for similar to 40% of blue water used for irrigation. The representation of anthropogenic activities in MATSIRO makes the model a suitable tool for assessing potential anthropogenic impacts on global water resources and hydrology."	https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-11-013.1	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Pokhrel, Y"	"Pokhrel, Y[Pokhrel, Yadu]; Hanasaki, N[Hanasaki, Naota]; Koirala, S[Koirala, Sujan]; Cho, J[Cho, Jaeil]; Yeh, PJF[Yeh, Pat J. -F.]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Kanae, S[Kanae, Shinjiro]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	8	타기관	3.273	2.403	5.00	Y	Article

However, the estimation of change in glacier mass still has a significant challenge because of a limited observational methodology to understand hydrological processes in Himalaya region. In this study, we estimate the ice loss rate for the Himalaya alpine region for the period January 2003 through December 2008, mainly using terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). To separate the effect of the other TWS components, simulated soil moisture, snow mass and river storage are calculated by using the Minimal Advanced Treatment of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO) land surface model (LMS). The methodology using GRACE data and LMS result is similar to one of previous studies. In addition, we also use groundwater withdrawal data, and our estimated glacier mass change is compares with glacier model (HYOGA) results. Finally, it is estimated that the melting rate of the glacier mass over target region is approximately 4.7 Gt/year. Although we believe that our methodology is the newest comparing previous one, our estimated value is much underestimated than HYOGA results. Our methodological experience and information will be helpful to better understand glacier mass change."	https://doi.org/10.2208/jscejhe.68.I_313	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Sasaki, O"	"Sasaki, O[Sasaki, O]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Hirabayashi, Y[Hirabayashi, Y]; Yamada, HG[Yamada, HG]; Kanae, S[Kanae, S]"	5	타기관				Y

In this study, we propose a new global river routing model, CaMa-Flood, which explicitly parameterizes the subgrid-scale topography of a floodplain, thus describing floodplain inundation dynamics. The relationship between water storage, water level, and flooded area in the model is decided on the basis of the subgrid-scale topographic parameters based on 1 km resolution digital elevation model. Horizontal water transport is calculated with a diffusive wave equation, which realizes the backwater effect in flat river basins. A set of global-scale river flow simulations demonstrated an improved predictability of daily-scale river discharge in many major world rivers by incorporating the floodplain inundation dynamics. Detailed analysis of the simulated results for the Amazon River suggested that introduction of the diffusive wave equation is essential for simulating water surface elevation realistically. The simulated spatiotemporal variation of the flooded area in the Amazon basin showed a good correlation with satellite observations, especially when the backwater effect was considered. The improved predictability for daily river discharge, water surface elevation, and inundated areas by the proposed model will promote climate system studies and water resource assessments."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2010WR009726	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Yamazaki, D"	"Yamazaki, D[Yamazaki, Dai]; Kanae, S[Kanae, Shinjiro]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]"	4	타기관	2.957	1.946	5.00	Y	Article

In this study, the effect of Atlantic SST on the spatial and temporal change of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the Amazonian region is examined by using satellite remote sensing data for the period of 1981-2001. A strong correlation between NDVI and SST is found for certain regions in Amazon during the periods of 1980s and 1990s, respectively. In addition, strong correlations with NDVI lagging behind SST for two months and one year, respectively, are also identified from the interannual December-to-February (rain season) variations during 1981-2001.

A simple yet effective runoff routing method based on a continuity equation is implemented to model horizontal transport of surface water within the Amazon basin. The GRACE observations are analyzed separately for soil moisture and surface water storages (generated from runoff), relying on their distinct spatial patterns, being disperse for soil moisture and localized for surface water. Various effective velocities for storage transport are tested against the GRACE observations. When the model runoff is routed with an uniform velocity of 30 cm/s, the annual variation of the resulting surface water storage is generally found to be larger than the satellite measurements and ground gauge data by a factor of 1.5 or higher. The peak annual anomaly of surface water storage is observed around the midstream of the Amazon main stem. However, the runoff routing simulations present the peak amplitude consistently around the delta (downstream), unless the increasing velocity in a downstream region is used. As complements to the ground gauge data, the satellite observations provide unique 'spatial' information of water cycle parameters. Our analysis indicates possible shortcomings in the certain LSM mass transport scheme between atmosphere and land surface, particularly the production of too large seasonal variations in runoff (and maybe too little variations in evapotranspiration), and the dynamic characteristics of surface water transport within the Amazon basins."	https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GC003214	2021-07-13	2021-07-14	"Han, SC"	"Han, SC[Han, Shin-Chan]; Yeo, IY[Yeo, In-Young]; Alsdorf, D[Alsdorf, Doug]; Bates, P[Bates, Paul]; Boy, JP[Boy, Jean-Paul]; Kim, H[Kim, Hyungjun]; Oki, T[Oki, Taikan]; Rodell, M[Rodell, Matthew]"	8	타기관	3.368	2.903	5.00	Y	Article

The contribution of individual storage components to total TWS is investigated by using ensemble hydrological simulations with river routing. The observed Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) TWS data are used to validate model simulations. It is found TWS simulations are more accurate when river storage is taken into account except for dry basins. Rivers play different roles in various climatic regions as indicated by two new indices quantifying the significance of each TWS component and their interactions. River storage, which effectively includes downslope movement of shallow groundwater, explains up to 73% of TWS variations in Amazon. It also acts as ""buffer'' which smoothes TWS seasonal variations particularly in snow-dominated basins. Neglecting river storage may lead to mismatch in the amplitude and phase of TWS seasonal variations compared to the GRACE observations. Citation: Kim, H., P. J.-F. Yeh, T. Oki, and S.

The surface water in the channels and floodplains can be significant in weighing total water storage. Its magnitude can be as large as soil moisture perturbing the motions of the satellites to a detectable amount by the on-board instrument. The river runoff routing simulations indicate the effective velocity throughout the Amazon basin over the years is about 30 cm/s with significant seasonal change. The lower velocity, during rising stages and peak water season, and the faster velocity, during falling stages, are delineated from the observations. The backwater effects may impact such seasonal change on the overall flow velocity. Direct assimilation of GRACE tracking data can contribute to land surface dynamic processes by resolving the time scale of transport in rivers and streams. Citation: Han, S.-C., H. Kim, I.-Y. Yeo, P.

The resulting gridded gauge-based analysis of precipitation was validated against observed river discharge data. The validation demonstrated that the product is reasonable, mostly because of the undercatch adjustment.
