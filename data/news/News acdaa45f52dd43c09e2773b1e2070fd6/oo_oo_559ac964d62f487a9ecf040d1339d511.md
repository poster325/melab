On September 23, 2024, the Moon Soul Graduate School of Future Strategy at KAIST successfully hosted the "Workshop on AI for Earth Sciences: Innovations and Applications." This event brought together distinguished researchers and industry leaders to discuss cutting-edge technologies and methodologies for efficiently processing large-scale physical-model-based simulations and observational data in the field of Earth sciences and climate change.

The workshop featured presentations by Prof. Hyungjun Kim (Me lab, KAIST) on neural network strategies, Dr. Karandeep Singh (UCLA) on machine learning for climate downscaling, Dr. Min-jong Jeon (KIST) on deep learning for global weather forecasting, and Mr. Takumi Bannai (ME-Lab Japan) on leveraging satellite data and simulations for industrial sustainability.

The workshop provided a platform for knowledge sharing and collaboration, fostering insightful discussions on the intersection of AI and Earth sciences.
