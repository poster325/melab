The workshop is a joint initiative between the MetaEarth Laboratory (ME Lab) at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the Laboratory of River and Watershed Engineering (LRWE Lab) at Hokkaido University, Japan. Two research groups working on hydrology and a wide range of related topics are holding the collaborative workshop. We shared our research expertise each other and discussed how we can integrate knowledge and techniques to improve our studies, seeking long-term research cooperation.
