Prof. Jan Polcher, Director at CNRS and Co-Chair of the GEWEX Science Steering Group, visites KAIST, and gave us a fruitful seminar on the critical challenges of predicting changes in water resources under the combined pressures of climate change and water usage. This seminar explored the advanced strategies employed by the ORCHIDEE land surface model within the Earth system model of IPSL to address these complexities.
